Class 3 will be on Tuesday 2017-09-05

Reminder: On Thursday, our class meets in room E401. This is the only time this semester that we are in a different room.

Today, we will discuss how to describe data numerically and graphically via R, R Studio and R Markdown, in an effort to help you get started with your first assignment.

Key materials include

- [this pdf](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431slides/blob/master/class_03/431_2017_class-03-slides.pdf) of the slides for Class 3.
  + there is also a R Markdown version available which I use to generate the PDF, but I doubt that will be much help right now.
- the [Class3_example.Rmd](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431slides/blob/master/class_03/Class3_example.Rmd) R Markdown file that I will create live in class to analyze the day 1 survey data, using 
  + the [YOURNAME-hw1.Rmd](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431slides/blob/master/class_03/YOURNAME-hw1.Rmd) template
  + and the [surveyday1_2017.csv](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431slides/blob/master/class_03/surveyday1_2017.csv) data file. 
  
Remember that the Teaching Assistants hold Office Hours (starting today) to help you with your R problems.
