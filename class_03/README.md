Class 3 is held on Tuesday 2017-09-05

**Reminder**: On Thursday, our class meets in **Room E401**. This is the only time this semester that we are in a different room.

Remember that the **Teaching Assistants** hold Office Hours (started today) to help you with your R problems. 
  - The schedule is posted on the front page of the web site at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431

If you are trying to get help from 431-help at case dot edu, that's great, but if you are trying to get help about an R problem send us **your complete R Markdown file, and a screen shot of the error message you're seeing**, please.

Today, we will discuss how to describe data numerically and graphically via R, R Studio and R Markdown, in an effort to help you get started with your first assignment. We'll also touch on some data related to kidney cancer. You'll hear more about the Project Portfolio assignment on Thursday.

Key materials include

- [this pdf](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431slides/blob/master/class_03/431_2017_class-03-slides.pdf) of the slides for Class 3.
- the [Class3_example.Rmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431slides/master/class_03/Class3_example.Rmd) R Markdown file that I will create live in class to analyze the day 1 survey data, using 
  + the [YOURNAME-hw1.Rmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431slides/master/class_03/YOURNAME-hw1.Rmd) template
  + and the [surveyday1_2017.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431slides/master/class_03/surveyday1_2017.csv) data file. 
  
**Reminders and Assignments**:

1. Thursday, we’ll be discussing some highlights from Jeff Leek’s The Elements of Data Analytic Style, chapters 5, 9, 10 and 13.
Your assignment is to **bring a sheet of paper containing at least one (written down) question and/or comment** about something in the text that is meaningful to you. No need to put your name on the paper. You will be sharing this information with a colleague.
2. We will begin discussing the NHANES data example in class on Thursday. It's discussed in Sections 1-6 (well, really 3-6) of the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431notes/) which you might want to review in advance.
3. Remember that you need to read the Introduction and Chapter 1 (about 50 pages) of Nate Silver's *The Signal and the Noise* by Class 5 (one week from today - 2017-09-12).
4. Remember that [Assignment 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/blob/master/431-2017_assignment-1.md) is due 2017-09-15 (next Friday) at noon.
