Class 3 will be on Tuesday 2017-09-05

Reminder: On Thursday, our class meets in room E401. This is the only time this semester that we are in a different room.

Today, we will discuss how to describe data numerically and graphically via R, R Studio and R Markdown, in an effort to help you get started with your first assignment.

Key materials include

- this pdf of the slides for Class 3.
- this R Markdown file that I will create live in class to analyze the day 1 survey data, using 
  + the YOURNAME-hw1.Rmd template
  + and the survey_day1_2017.csv data file.
  
Remember that the Teaching Assistants hold Office Hours (starting today) to help you with your R problems.
