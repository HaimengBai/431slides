## Today's Slides

Today's Slides are available for download in both [PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431slides/blob/master/class_24/431_2017_class-24-slides.pdf) and [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431slides/blob/master/class_24/431_2017_class-24-slides.Rmd) formats. 

The audio recording(s) for this class will be posted above when they become available.

## Announcements before class:

1. What Dr. Love Intends To Do Over the Break
    - Build a short report on class achivement for the Activity After Class 22, regarding p hacking and paired/independent samples.
    - Build a short document with some additional examples on distinguishing paired / matched samples from independent samples, and indicating what you can do inferentially with paired samples in categorical data analyses, and with matched groups larger than pairs (liked matched trios) in analyzing quantitative outcomes.
    - Build an Activity to be done after Class 24 online.
    - Grade and react to Project Task D, which is due on Monday 2017-11-20, at noon. (I plan to finish looking at these on Tuesday morning.) The [Project Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/blob/master/TaskF/SCHEDULE.md) now indicates whether I've received and approved Task D for your group.
    - Prepare at least tentative slides for classes 24-27.

2. Reminders
    - Those of you planning (or needing) to complete the [Quiz 2 Extra Task](https://goo.gl/forms/1f27voQF33hqYOys1), do so by noon on Wednesday 2017-11-29.
    - If you haven't done so in a while, you really should consider upgrading R to version 3.4.2 (or later) and R Studio (I use version 1.1.383) - that will let you upgrade all of your packages, especially to version 1.2.1 (or later) of the tidyverse. Details, if you've forgotten what to do, are in [the software installation instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431/blob/master/software-installation-431.md).
    - Some people may be looking for extra help outside of normal office hours between now and the end of their project. Some TAs are willing to meet with you by appointment as the semester comes to a close. If you're interested, email 431-help. As a reminder, regular TA office hours are posted in [the Course Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431syllabus/teaching-assistants.html#office-hours-for-tas).
    - I posted some minor revisions to the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431notes/), in Sections 28, 37, 38, 42 and 49. None of these changes were substantial, though I am very grateful to readers for pointing out issues, big or small.

3. Today's Agenda
    - Modeling in the Tidyverse (Part C of the Course)
        - See [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431notes/), sections 37-. 

4. The Projects
    - You should be able to do all of your Project related to the Class Survey (Study 1) now. Things you'll need:
        - [Survey data and R Markdown file for cleaning](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/tree/master/SURVEY2017)
        - [Study 1 demonstration in Task E](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/tree/master/TaskE)
    - For "your data" (Study 2), I refer you to:
        - Your Project Task D - note that the [Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/blob/master/TaskF/SCHEDULE.md) indicates whether I've received and approved your work on Task D.
        - [Study 2 demonstration in Task E](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/tree/master/TaskE)
    - Please [recheck the Project Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/blob/master/TaskF/SCHEDULE.md) to ensure you won't have a problem coming to my office at the planned time, and to ensure that all Tasks to date (should be A-D) are complete.

5. Upcoming non-project Deliverables
    - [Assignment 6](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/blob/master/431-2017_assignment-6.md) is due at noon **2017-12-01**.
        - In an attempt to ease the burden of the remainder of the course, and to keep the focus where it needs to be (on the project), you will see that **Questions 1 and 6 are no longer part of the assignment**. Instead, you are to do **Questions 2-5**, only.
        - To help you with Assignment 6, I encourage you to take advantage of three resources:
            - I have posted our [grading rubric for Questions 2-5](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/blob/master/HW6/README.md) to help you gauge exactly what we're looking for in your responses.
            - The 431 Project Study 2 demonstration material in Task E is directly relevant to Questions 2-5. (2-6 actually, but we're not doing 6.) There's a [PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/blob/master/HW6/README.md) and a [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/blob/master/TaskE/431-project-study2-demonstration.Rmd) file to help you.
            - Everything you need is also in Part C of the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431notes/introduction-for-part-c.html).
    - **Appealing HW Grades**: Once all six assignments are complete and you know your grades on each, you may find an error in grading that you would like Dr. Love to review. Request this by filling out [this Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/v5zBIuGnrLkbiuXU2). 
        - The deadline is noon on 2017-12-13.
        - Dr. Love will only consult this form if your course grade might plausibly be affected by the changes you request. 
        - See the [Grade Appeal Policy](https://thomaselove.github.io/431syllabus/general-course-policies.html#grade-appeal-policy---wait-until-december) in the Syllabus for more details.
    - **Quiz 3** will be made available to you on 2017-12-07 by 5 PM and is due at noon on Monday 2017-12-11.
