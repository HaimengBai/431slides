## Announcements before class:

1. What Dr. Love Intends To Do Over the Break
    - Build a short report on class achivement for the Activity After Class 22, regarding p hacking and paired/independent samples.
    - Build a short document with some additional examples on distinguishing paired / matched samples from independent samples, and indicating what you can do inferentially with paired samples in categorical data analyses, and with matched groups larger than pairs (liked matched trios) in analyzing quantitative outcomes.
    - Build an Activity to be done after Class 24 online.
    - Build the document you will use to request that I revisit your grading on Assignments 1-6. This document is to be submitted in December, after you receive your grade on Assignment 6.
    - Grade and react to Project Task D, which is due on Monday 2017-11-20, at noon. (I plan to grade these Tuesday morning.)
    - Prepare at least tentative slides for classes 24-27.

2. Reminders
    - Those of you planning (or needing) to complete the [Quiz 2 Extra Task](https://goo.gl/forms/1f27voQF33hqYOys1), do so by noon on Wednesday 2017-11-29.
    - If you haven't done so in a while, you really should consider upgrading R to version 3.4.2 (or later) and R Studio (I use version 1.1.383) - that will let you upgrade all of your packages, especially to version 1.2.1 (or later) of the tidyverse.

3. Today's Agenda
    - Modeling in the Tidyverse (Part C of the Course)
        - See [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431notes/), sections 37-. 

4. The Projects
    - You should be able to do all of your Project related to the Class Survey (Study 1) now. Things you'll need:
        - [Survey data and R Markdown file for cleaning](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/tree/master/SURVEY2017)
        - [Study 1 demonstration in Task E](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/tree/master/TaskE)
    - For "your data" (Study 2), I refer you to:
        - Your Project Task D
        - [Study 2 demonstration in Task E](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/tree/master/TaskE)
    - Please [recheck the Project Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/blob/master/TaskF/SCHEDULE.md) to ensure you won't have a problem coming to my office at the planned time.

5. Upcoming non-project Deliverables
    - [Assignment 6](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/blob/master/431-2017_assignment-6.md) is due at noon **2017-12-01**.
        - In an attempt to ease the burden of the remainder of the course, and to keep the focus where it needs to be (on the project), you will see that **Questions 1 and 6 are no longer part of the assignment**. Instead, you are to do **Questions 2-5**, only.
        - If you have already done work on Question 1 or 6, please feel free to include it and we'll award a little extra credit on the assignment, but if you haven't started on those two questions, then just do questions 2-5. 
    - Quiz 3 is scheduled to be available to you on 2017-12-07 and is due at noon on 2017-12-11.
