## Announcements before class:

0. Dr. Love's remaining punch list from the Thanksgiving break...
    - Prepare tentative slides for Classes 26-27.
    - Build an Activity to be done after Class 24 online.
    - Build Quiz 3.

2. Today's Agenda
    - Changing the `eda.2sam` function from `Love-boost.R` to the `eda.ksam` function that is now also in `Love-boost.R`
        - See [this PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431data/blob/master/Updating_Love-boost.pdf) for details and a demonstration of how to use the new `eda.ksam` function. 
            - The versions of `Love-boost.R` on this web site now include this new function. 
            - I think that all of the material on this site has this change in place but you'll tell me if I am wrong
                - This includes revised [Class 19 Slides](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431slides/tree/master/class_19), and a revised [Assignment 4 Sketch](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/tree/master/HW4).
    - Modeling in the Tidyverse (Part C of the Course)
        - Box-Cox procedure for identifying potential outcome transformations
        - Adjusted R-squared in multiple regression as an indicator of overfitting
        - The assessment of collinearity (correlated predictors) with the VIF (variance inflation factor)
        - Pruning / Testing "Kitchen Sink" models
            + based on t tests for individual predictors (as "last predictor in")
            + based on ANOVA F tests for groups of predictors
            + based on stepwise AIC comparisons
        - Checking Model Assumptions with Residual Plots
        - Summarizing a Model in Words
        - See [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431notes/), sections 37-. 

3. The Projects
    - You should be able to do all of your Project related to the Class Survey (Study 1) now. Things you'll need:
        - [Survey data and R Markdown file for cleaning](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/tree/master/SURVEY2017) - note that on 2017-11-26, we made a small correction to more correctly spell `surv_tidy$Q078d_Other_caffeinated`.
        - [Study 1 demonstration in Task E](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/tree/master/TaskE) - and Dr. Love edited this on 2017-11-26 to use `eda.ksam` instead of `eda.2sam` and also to correct a few typos.
    - For "your data" (Study 2), I refer you to:
        - Your Project Task D - note that the [Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/blob/master/TaskF/SCHEDULE.md) indicates whether I've received and approved your work on Task D.
        - [Study 2 demonstration in Task E](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/tree/master/TaskE)
    - Please [recheck the Project Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/blob/master/TaskF/SCHEDULE.md) to ensure you won't have a problem coming to my office at the planned time, and to ensure that all Tasks to date (should be A-D) are complete.
    - [Project Task E](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/tree/master/TaskE) is your final report, due at noon Wednesday 2017-12-13. A reminder that **all** of the documentation you provide there must be generated using R Markdown, and then presented using the HTML, Word or PDF file generated by your R Markdown files.
    - [Project Task F](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/tree/master/TaskF) is the final presentation. 

4. Non-project Deliverables
    - **Quiz 2 Extra Task** Those of you planning (or needing) to complete the [Quiz 2 Extra Task](https://goo.gl/forms/1f27voQF33hqYOys1), do so by noon on Wednesday **2017-11-29**.
    - [Assignment 6](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/blob/master/431-2017_assignment-6.md) is due at noon **2017-12-01**.
        - In an attempt to ease the burden of the remainder of the course, and to keep the focus where it needs to be (on the project), you will see that **Questions 1 and 6 are no longer part of the assignment**. Instead, you are to do **Questions 2-5**, only.
        - To help you with Assignment 6, I encourage you to take advantage of three resources:
            - I have posted our [grading rubric for Questions 2-5](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/blob/master/HW6/README.md) to help you gauge exactly what we're looking for in your responses.
            - The 431 Project Study 2 demonstration material in Task E is directly relevant to Questions 2-5. (2-6 actually, but we're not doing 6.) There's a [PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/blob/master/HW6/README.md) and a [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/blob/master/TaskE/431-project-study2-demonstration.Rmd) file to help you.
            - Everything you need is also in Part C of the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431notes/introduction-for-part-c.html).
    - **Quiz 3** will be made available to you on 2017-12-07 by 5 PM and is due at noon on Monday 2017-12-11.
    - **Appealing HW Grades**: Once all six assignments are complete and you know your grades on each, you may find an error in grading that you would like Dr. Love to review. Request this by filling out [this Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/v5zBIuGnrLkbiuXU2). 
        - The deadline is noon on 2017-12-13.
        - Dr. Love will only consult this form if your course grade might plausibly be affected by the changes you request. 
        - See the [Grade Appeal Policy](https://thomaselove.github.io/431syllabus/general-course-policies.html#grade-appeal-policy---wait-until-december) in the Syllabus for more details.

5. Reminders
    - **Upgrade R and R Studio** If you haven't done so in a while, you really should consider upgrading R to version 3.4.2 (or later) and R Studio (I use version 1.1.383) - that will let you upgrade all of your packages, especially to version 1.2.1 (or later) of the tidyverse. Details, if you've forgotten what to do, are in [the software installation instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431/blob/master/software-installation-431.md).
    - **Need Extra Help?** Some people may be looking for extra help outside of normal office hours between now and the end of their project. Some TAs are willing to meet with you by appointment at alternate times (for example, in the evening) as the semester comes to a close. If you're interested, email 431-help. As a reminder, regular TA office hours are posted in [the Course Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431syllabus/teaching-assistants.html#office-hours-for-tas).
    - [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431notes/) **revisions** 
        - I added a **new section** (25.10) on dependent (paired) vs. independent samples approaches to comparing quantitative outcomes, which includes the questions and answers from the After Class 22 activity.
        - In addition, I posted some minor revisions to the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431notes/), in Sections 28, 37, 38, 42 and 49. I am very grateful to readers for pointing out issues, big or small.
    - **R Tip**: Want to check a tibble (data frame) to see if there are any missing values? 
        - Instead of using `mice::md.pattern` or `Hmisc::describe` you might consider `any(is.na(dataframe))` if all you need is a TRUE (meaning there are missing values in the data frame) or a FALSE (meaning there are no missing values in the data frame.)
        - The `md.pattern` approach from `mice` seems to run into trouble on occasion dealing with variables of the class `character`. If you have character class variables (list your tibble to check or use `str()` to find out) then the md.pattern approach will treat those as NA values.
