## Announcements before class:

1. We will continue our discussion of material from the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431notes/), especially...
    + Using Transformations to "Normalize" and to "Linearize" (Chapters 9, 11)
    + Summarizing Data within Subgroups (Chapter 10)
    + Associations and Using Linear Models (Chapter 11) as demonstrated using a study of von Hippel-Lindau disease. [Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome](http://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/von-hippel-lindau-syndrome) (VHL) is a hereditary condition associated with tumors arising in multiple organs.

2. TA Office Hours tomorrow (Friday 2017-09-23) will be held from **2-3 PM** instead of the usual 4:30 - 5:30 PM.

6. Readings for the rest of September:

- Read Nate Silver's *The Signal and the Noise* Chapters 2 (Political Predictions) and 3 (Baseball predictions) by **2017-09-26**.
- By the end of the month, work your way through Part A of the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431notes/). We'll cover Chapters 9-11 extensively in class, and 12-13 (which show detailed examples) more lightly.
- I also suggest working your way through [R For Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). All of the **Explore** and **Wrangle** material is likely to be helpful in Part A of the course.
