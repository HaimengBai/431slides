## Announcements before class:

1. Today's Agenda includes... 
    + Material from the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431notes/) especially in Chapters 8-11.
    + [Assignment 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/blob/master/431-2017_assignment-1.md) and its password-protected [answer sketch](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/blob/master/431-sketch1-pw-2017.pdf).
    + We'll also visit the [Old Faithful Geyser's Live Webcam](https://www.nps.gov/features/yell/webcam/oldFaithfulStreaming.html).
    + An introduction to the Course Project.

2. There will be a Google Form to fill out after today's class. Please complete this by Noon on Thursday 2017-09-21.

3. Remember that [Assignment 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/blob/master/431-2017_assignment-2.md) is due at noon this Friday, 2017-09-22.

4. R Studio recently announced a new forum called the [R Studio Community](https://blog.rstudio.com/2017/09/14/rstudio-community/).

5. Readings for the rest of September:

- Read Nate Silver's *The Signal and the Noise* Chapters 2 (Political Predictions) and 3 (Baseball predictions) by 2017-09-26.
- By the end of the month, work your way through Part A of the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431notes/). We'll cover Chapters 9-11 extensively in class, and 12-13 (which show detailed examples) more lightly.
- I also suggest working your way through [R For Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). All of the **Explore** and **Wrangle** material is likely to be helpful in Part A of the course.

More to come.
