## Announcements before class:

1. Today's Agenda includes... 
    + Material from the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431notes/) especially in Chapters 8-11.
    + [Assignment 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/blob/master/431-2017_assignment-1.md) and its password-protected [answer sketch](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/blob/master/431-sketch1-pw-2017.pdf).
    + We'll also visit the [Old Faithful Geyser's Live Webcam](https://www.nps.gov/features/yell/webcam/oldFaithfulStreaming.html). 11 AM Mountain time is 1 PM Eastern time.
    + An introduction to the Course Project.
    + I mentioned last time that FiveThirtyEight did a nice article on "[Which States Are in the Midwest](https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/what-states-are-in-the-midwest/)?" More on this to come.

2. There is a [Class 7 Google Form to complete](https://goo.gl/forms/UWWSx5vzJQf2X35D3) **by 11 AM** on Thursday 2017-09-21. This is part of your class participation grade.

3. Remember that [Assignment 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/blob/master/431-2017_assignment-2.md) is due at noon this Friday, 2017-09-22.

4. Claudia Cabrera built a great slide deck [introducing and providing some tips on using R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431slides/blob/master/class_07/2017-09-19_Claudia_Cabrera_Intro-to-Markdown-and-some-tips.pdf). Please take a look as you are preparing Assignment 2 and later work.

5. There is a [Cleveland R User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Cleveland-UseR-Group/events/242960813/), which you might be interested in joining. This group is designed for novice to expert R users to share tips, ideas, and experiences.  Meetings will be designed to learn and challenge.  A typical meetup consists of brief socializing and a presentation. The next meetup is on 2017-09-27.

6. The Tidyverse webinar from Garrett Grolemund is [now posted online at R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/tidyverse-visualization-and-manipulation-basics/). It's an excellent workshop.

7. R Studio also recently announced a new forum called the [R Studio Community](https://blog.rstudio.com/2017/09/14/rstudio-community/).

8. Readings for the rest of September:

- Read Nate Silver's *The Signal and the Noise* Chapters 2 (Political Predictions) and 3 (Baseball predictions) by 2017-09-26.
- By the end of the month, work your way through Part A of the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431notes/). We'll cover Chapters 9-11 extensively in class, and 12-13 (which show detailed examples) more lightly.
- I also suggest working your way through [R For Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). All of the **Explore** and **Wrangle** material is likely to be helpful in Part A of the course.

## Announcements after class:

9. Please complete the [Google Form after Class 7](https://goo.gl/forms/UWWSx5vzJQf2X35D3) by **11 AM Thursday**. Remember that you'll need to log into Google via CWRU to complete the form. Thank you.

More to come.
