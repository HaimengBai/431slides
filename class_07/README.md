## Today's Slides

Today's Slides are available for download in both [PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431slides/blob/master/class_07/431_2017_class-07-slides.pdf) and [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431slides/blob/master/class_07/431_2017_class-07-slides.Rmd) formats.

## Announcements before class:

1. I mentioned last time that FiveThirtyEight did a nice article on "[Which States Are in the Midwest](https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/what-states-are-in-the-midwest/)?" To that end, I sent you an email (on Sunday) that asked you to fill out a brief survey called "The Midwest Survey" for 431 Class 7. You should be able to fill out and submit the form in your email, but if not, you can [visit the form and fill it out here](https://goo.gl/forms/pKthnDsY6i3edZY32). Thanks!

2. Today's Agenda includes... 
    + Material from the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431notes/) in Chapters 8-11, especially 9 and 10.
    + [Assignment 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/blob/master/431-2017_assignment-1.md) and its password-protected [answer sketch](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/blob/master/HW1/README.md). You should have received your HW-ID code from me in an email. Hang onto it - you'll need it all semester long. [Grades on the assignment](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/tree/master/HW1) and the [grading rubric](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/tree/master/HW1) went up this morning.
    + We'll also visit the [Old Faithful Geyser's Live Webcam](https://www.nps.gov/features/yell/webcam/oldFaithfulStreaming.html). 11 AM Mountain time is 1 PM Eastern time.
    + **Course Project**: A Brief Introduction. All materials and information related to the project will be maintained at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project. Regular updates will appear there throughout the semester.
    + Some discussion of the data from the Midwest Survey, described above.

3. There is a different [Class 7 Google Form to complete](https://goo.gl/forms/UWWSx5vzJQf2X35D3) after class and **before 11 AM** on Thursday 2017-09-21. This is part of your class participation grade. The little Midwest Survey is a separate issue.

4. Remember that [Assignment 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/blob/master/431-2017_assignment-2.md) is due at noon this Friday, 2017-09-22.

5. Claudia Cabrera built a great slide deck [introducing and providing some tips on using R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431slides/blob/master/class_07/2017-09-19_Claudia_Cabrera_Intro-to-Markdown-and-some-tips.pdf). Please take a look as you are preparing Assignment 2 and later work.

6. There is a [Cleveland R User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Cleveland-UseR-Group/events/242960813/), which you might be interested in joining. This group is designed for novice to expert R users to share tips, ideas, and experiences.  Meetings will be designed to learn and challenge.  A typical meetup consists of brief socializing and a presentation. The next meetup is on 2017-09-27.

7. The Tidyverse webinar from Garrett Grolemund is [now posted online at R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/tidyverse-visualization-and-manipulation-basics/). It's an excellent workshop.

8. R Studio also recently announced a new forum called the [R Studio Community](https://blog.rstudio.com/2017/09/14/rstudio-community/).

9. Readings for the rest of September:

- Read Nate Silver's *The Signal and the Noise* Chapters 2 (Political Predictions) and 3 (Baseball predictions) by 2017-09-26.
- By the end of the month, work your way through Part A of the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431notes/). We'll cover Chapters 9-11 extensively in class, and 12-13 (which show detailed examples) more lightly.
- I also suggest working your way through [R For Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). All of the **Explore** and **Wrangle** material is likely to be helpful in Part A of the course.

## Announcements after class:

10. After class, please complete the [Google Form after Class 7](https://goo.gl/forms/UWWSx5vzJQf2X35D3) by **11 AM Thursday**. Remember that you'll need to log into Google via CWRU to complete the form. Thank you.

11. If you have complaints about your grade on a homework assignment, please review [Section 13.1 of the Course Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431syllabus/general-course-policies.html#grade-appeal-policy---wait-until-december) first. As you'll see there, we request that you not *dispute* any grading until December.
