## Announcements before class:

1. Today's Agenda
    - Quiz 2
        - Grades and the answer sketch will be available before class. You should have received an email from me about your grade.
    - Discussion of the After Class 22 Activity ([Google Form here](https://goo.gl/forms/GEXC4gxQV4aTJb8D3))
        - The activity required you to read [this short primer on p hacking](https://www.methodspace.com/primer-p-hacking/).
        - Andrew Gelman: [What should this student do? His bosses want him to p-hack and they donâ€™t even know it!](http://andrewgelman.com/2017/11/11/student-bosses-want-p-hack-dont-even-know/)
    - Update for the `tidyverse` - [details here](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/11/tidyverse_1.2.0/) - get version 1.2.1 by updating the tidyverse package in R Studio.
    - Modeling in the Tidyverse (Part C of the Course) begins.
        - See [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431notes/), sections 37-.

2. The Projects
    - You should be able to do all of your Project related to the Class Survey (Study 1) now.
        - Get the [data and the R Markdown file](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/tree/master/SURVEY2017) you'll need to clean and rename the data.
        - See the complete [Study 1 demonstration in Task E](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/tree/master/TaskE) using old survey data ([R Markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/master/TaskE/431-project-study1-demonstration.Rmd) and [PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/blob/master/TaskE/431-project-study1-demonstration.pdf) available.)
    - [Task D](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/tree/master/TaskD) is due via email to Dr. Love noon Monday, **2017-11-20**.
        - If you're working with NHANES data, I want to know what tables you used, and I want your cleaned tidied data set, but I don't need the raw pulls.
        - A tidy data set is just a .csv file in almost all cases, rather than multiple .csv files. One .csv file, with one row per subject and one column per variable.
        - Your submitted project (Tasks E/F) files should begin by importing your tidy data set (from Task D) and then manipulating the data as needed before you move into the analysis phase. But the data need to be tidy at the start. This applies for Study 1 and for Study 2.
        - To date, Project Task D is complete for Chaim Domb, Gwendolyn Donley, Kedar Mahajan, and Roberto Martinez. Thanks!

3. Upcoming non-project Deliverables
    - [Assignment 6](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/blob/master/431-2017_assignment-6.md) is due at noon **2017-12-01**.
