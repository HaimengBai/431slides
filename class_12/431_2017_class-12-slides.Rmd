## Leek, Chapter 2

```{r Leek2, out.width = '90%', fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Leek-data-analysis-question.png")
```

## Leek, Chapter 3 (Tidying the Data)

Components of a Processed Data Set

1. The raw data.
2. A tidy data set.
3. A code book describing each variable and its values in the tidy data set.
4. An explicit and exact recipe you used to go from 1 to 2 to 3.

See https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing for a guide for your project.

## Leek, Chapter 4 (Checking the Data)

- Coding variables appropriately
    + Continuous, Ordinal, Categorical, Missing, Censored
- Code categorical / ordinal variables so that R will read them as factors.
- Encode everything using text, not with colors on the spreadsheet.
- Identify the missing value indicator, and use `NA` whenever you can.
- Check for coding errors, particularly label switching.

## Leek, Chapter 12 (Reproducibility)

Reproducibility of workflow is what we're aiming for.

- Everything in a script. (R Markdown)
- Everything stored in a plain text file (future-proof: .csv, .Rmd)
- Organize your data analysis in subfolders of the project directory
- Use version control (something I should do more of)
- Add `sessionInfo()` command to final version of work when you need to preserve the details on software and parameters - see next slide.

## My session info, at home, 2017-10-03

Include this information in your project submissions, but not probably in your other assignments, unless we ask you for it.

```{r session-info-new, out.width = '95%', fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sessioninfo-2017-10-03.png")
```

## Today's R Setup

```{r packages, message = FALSE}
library(mice); library(tidyverse)

source("Love-boost.R")
```

## `dplyr` basics: The Key Verbs

Six key functions:

- Pick observations by their values (`filter()`).
- Reorder the rows (`arrange()`).
- Pick variables by their names (`select()`).
- Collapse many values down to a single summary (`summarise()`).
- Create new variables with functions of existing variables (`mutate()`).
- Change the scope of another function from operating on the whole data set to operating on it group-by-group (`group_by()`)

> All of this comes from Wickham and Grolemund, R for Data Science, Chapter 5

http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#introduction-2

## `dplyr` basics: How the verbs work

- The first argument is a data frame (or tibble).
- The second arguments describe what to do with the data frame. You can refer to columns in the data frame directly without using `$`.
- The result is a new data frame.

We'll work with the `wcgs` data.

```{r get a tibble of wcgs data}
wcgs <- read.csv("wcgs.csv") %>% tbl_df
wcgs
```

## Filter rows with `filter()`

`filter()` allows you to subset observations based on their values.

```{r filter wcgs to get those with}
wcgs.sub1 <- wcgs %>%
  filter(dibpat == "Type A" & age > 49)
wcgs.sub1
```

## Comparison and Logical Operators

Comparison Operator | Meaning
-------------------:| ---------------
`>` | is greater than
`>=` | is greater than or equal to
`<` | is less than
`<=` | is less than or equal to
`!=` | is not equal to
`==` | is equal to

Logical (Boolean) Operator | Meaning
-------------------:| ---------------
`&` | and
`|` | or
`!` | not

Missing Values (`NA` in R) can make things tricky. They are contagious. Almost any operation involving an unknown value will also be unknown.

## The complete set of Boolean Operators

```{r boolean-fig, out.width = '90%', fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/boolean.png")
```

Source: http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#logical-operators

## Arrange rows with `arrange()`

`arrange()`, instead of selecting rows (like `filter()`), changes their order. 

- Use `arrange(height)` to arrange in ascending order of height. Provide a second column name to break ties, if you like. 
- Missing values are always sorted at the end.

```{r arrange wcgs by height and then weight}
wcgs %>%
  arrange(desc(height), desc(weight))
```

## Select columns with `select()`

`select()` lets you zoom in on the columns you actually want to use based on the names of the variables. [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#select-columns-with-select) lays out some helper functions within select() for use in bigger data sets. 

```{r select columns from wcgs of interest}
wcgs.sub2 <- wcgs %>%
  select(id, age, height, weight, dibpat, smoke, behpat)
wcgs.sub2
```

## Grouped summaries with `summarize()`

`summarise()` or `summarize()` collapses a data frame to a single row.

```{r summarize mean height and correlation of key vars}
wcgs.sub2 %>%
  summarize(mean.ht = mean(height, na.rm=TRUE), 
            sd.ht = sd(height, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  round(digits = 2)
```

## Using the pipe (`%>%`) to filter and summarize

```{r summarize correlation of height and weight}
wcgs.sub2 %>%
 filter(dibpat == "Type A") %>%
 summarize(pearson.r = cor(height, weight), 
  spearman.r = cor(height, weight, method = "spearman")) %>%
 round(digits = 3) %>%
 knitr::kable()
```

## Using `group_by()` with summarize to look group-by-group

```{r summarize correlation within behavior patterns}
wcgs.sub2 %>%
  group_by(behpat) %>%
  summarize(
    pearson.r = round(cor(height, weight),3) ) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

## Using `group_by()` to look at separated groups

You might have tried this approach instead, but it throws an error...

```{r summarize correlation within behavior patterns but apply rounding incorrectly, eval=FALSE}
wcgs.sub2 %>%
  group_by(behpat) %>%
  summarize(
    pearson.r = cor(height, weight)) %>%
  round(digits = 3) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

>- Why doesn't this work?
>- When R sees the round command, it tries to apply it to every element of the table, including the behavior pattern labels, which aren't numbers. So it throws an error.

## Add new variables with `mutate()`

`mutate()` adds new columns that are functions of existing columns to the end of your data set.

Suppose we want to calculate the weight/height ratio for each subject.

```{r add weight to height ratio to the data as a new column}
wcgs.sub3 <- wcgs.sub2 %>%
  mutate(wh.ratio = weight / height)
wcgs.sub3
```

## On Coding and dplyr

1. Learn `dplyr`, and use it to do most of your data management within R.
    + `dplyr` is mostly about these key verbs, and piping, for our purposes
    + some tasks produce results which be confusing, we're here to help
2. `dplyr` is most useful in combination with other elements of the `tidyverse`, most prominently `ggplot2`.
3. `Hmisc` doesn't play nicely with `dplyr`, so don't load the whole Hmisc library, just call individual functions you need with, for example, `Hmisc::describe` or `Hmisc::smean.cl.boot`

## The Printer Case, Setup

```{r printer1-fig, out.width = '90%', fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/printer1.png")
```

## The Printer Case, Main Table

```{r printer2-fig, out.width = '90%', fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/printer2.png")
```

## The Printer Case Discussion, Part 1

Fifty days of data. Fifth floor employees were given a card to operate their printer. Third floor employees were not.

1. Is this a randomized trial or an observational study?
2. What is the outcome we are studying?
3. What are the two treatments/exposures/interventions being compared?
4. What controls are in place as part of the study's design?
5. **Key Question**: Will the card accounting system effectively lower usage if implemented across the firm?

## The Printer Case Discussion

Go.

## Printer Case: Numerical Summary

```{r printer1}
printer <- read.csv("printer.csv") %>% tbl_df
summary(printer)
```

## Printer Case: Scatterplot (r = 0.11)

```{r printer scatterplot, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(printer, aes(x = Third, y = Fifth)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 18)) + 
  labs(x = "Third Floor Pages", y = "Fifth Floor Pages")
```

## Printer Case: Gather the Columns

First, we'll gather up the data so that we can plot it more easily.

```{r printer2}
printer2 <- tidyr::gather(printer, Floor, Pages, -Day)
printer2
```

## Printer Case: Comparison Boxplot

```{r printer 2 boxplots, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(printer2, aes(x = Floor, y = Pages, fill = Floor)) +
  geom_boxplot(notch = TRUE) +
  coord_flip() +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 18))
```

## Printer Case: Third Floor

```{r printer plot for Third Floor, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(printer, aes(x = Day, y = Third)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 18)) + 
  labs(title = "Third Floor Pages")
```

## Printer Case: Fifth Floor

```{r printer plot for Fifth Floor, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(printer, aes(x = Day, y = Fifth)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 18)) + 
  labs(title = "Fifth Floor Pages")
```

## Comparing the Patterns over Time

```{r printer2 scatterplot, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(printer2, aes(x = Day, y = Pages, col = Floor)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16)) + 
  guides(color = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ Floor) +
  labs(title = "Monitoring on Fifth Floor Reduced Pages")
```
