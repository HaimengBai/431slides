2. The Projects
    - Task A: Review the [status of all 43 project proposals](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/blob/master/TaskA/APPROVED.md).
        - Those of you without an approved proposal (Task A) should be in email contact with me.
    - [Task B materials](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/blob/master/TaskB/README.md) are due at noon on Monday **2017-10-23**.
        - So far, I've heard from these groups whose Task B looks OK:

        - One group has submitted Task B, but missed part 4, and will, I hope, repair that soon:
