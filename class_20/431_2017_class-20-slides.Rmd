```{r setup, message = FALSE}
library(magrittr); library(forcats);

## Titanic Example

Consider the following data on survival of the Titanic.

- Among the females, 308 survived and 143 died.
- Of 851 males on board, 142 survived.

What conclusions can you draw about the relationship of sex to survival?

## What are the comparisons we're making here?

Pr(survive | female) is the probability of survival, if you're female.

We want to compare Pr(survive | female) to Pr(survive | male).

How would we build such a comparison?

## Starting The 2x2 Table

- Among the females, 308 survived and 143 died.
- Of 851 males on board, 142 survived.


Titanic | Survive | Die  | Total
------: | ----: | ----: | ----:
Female | 308 | 143 | ??
Male   | 142 | ??  | 851
Total  | ??  | ??  | ??

## The Complete 2x2 Table

Titanic | Survive | Die  | Total
------: | ---: | ---: | ---:
Female | **308** | **143** | *451*
Male   | **142** | *709*  | **851**
Total  | *450*  | *852*  | *1,302*

Now, how do I get this into R?

## Two-by-Two table

```{r, message = FALSE}
twobytwo(308, 143, 142, 709, 
         "Female", "Male", "Survive", "Die")
```

## Complete 2x2 Result: Conclusions?

## A 2x3 Table: Comparing Response to Active vs. Placebo

The table below, specifies the number of patients who show *complete*, *partial*, or *no response* after treatment with either **active** medication or a **placebo**.

Group | None | Partial | Complete
-----:| :---:| :----: | :-----:
Active | 16 | 26 | 29
Placebo | 24 | 26 | 18

Is there a statistically significant association here? That is to say, is there a statistically significant difference between the treatment groups in the distribution of responses?

## Getting the Table into R

To answer this, we'll have to get the data from this contingency table into a matrix in R. Here's one approach...

```{r table2x3-a}
T1 <- matrix(c(16,26,29,24,26,18), 
             ncol=3, nrow=2, byrow=TRUE)
rownames(T1) <- c("Active", "Placebo")
colnames(T1) <- c("None", "Partial", "Complete")
T1
```

## Getting the Chi-Square Test Results

H~0~: rows and columns are independent vs. H~A~: rows and columns are associated

```{r table2x3-chi}
chisq.test(T1)
```

## Chi-Square Assumptions

We assume that the expected frequency, under the null hypothesized model of independence, will be **at least 5** in each cell. If that is not the case, then the $\chi^2$ test is likely to give unreliable results.

How do we calculate expected frequencies for a cell?

$$ 
\mbox{Expected Frequency} = \frac{\mbox{Row total} \times \mbox{Column total}}{\mbox{Grand Total}}
$$

This assumes that the independence model holds - that the probability of being in a particular column is exactly the same regardless of what row we're looking at.

## Calculating Expected Frequencies for the 2x3 Table

```{r}
addmargins(T1)
```

>- What is the expected frequency for the (Active, None) cell?
>- For (Active, None), row total = 71, column total = 40, grand total = 139, so expected frequency is $$\frac{71 \times 40}{139} = 20.43$$

## Expected Frequencies for the whole 2x3 table

---      | None   | Partial | Complete 
-------: | -----: | -----:  | -----: 
Active   | 20.4   | 26.6 | 24.0
Placebo  | 19.6 | 25.4 | 23.0

- All of these values exceed 5, so our $\chi^2$ results should be reasonable. 
- We could have run a **Fisher's exact test**, too...

## Fisher's Exact Test Results

H~0~: rows and columns are independent vs. H~A~: rows and columns are associated

```{r table2x3-fisher}
fisher.test(T1)
```

## Working with Survey Data

431 Day 1 Survey (1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree)

9. I prefer to learn from lectures than to learn from activities.
10. I prefer to work on projects alone than in a team.

```{r survey1-data}
sur1 <- surd1 %>%
  select(student, english, lecture, alone) %>%
  mutate(lecture = factor(lecture),
         alone = factor(alone))

sur1
```

## 5x5 Contingency Table

```{r get-table-A}
sur1 %$% table(lecture, alone) %>% addmargins
```

## Chi-Square testing

H~0~: No association of rows and columns

H~A~: Rows and columns are associated

```{r testing for table A}
sur1 %$% table(lecture, alone) %>% chisq.test
```

## Collapse Some Categories with `fct_recode` in `forcats`

9. I prefer to learn from lectures than to learn from activities. (1 = SD, 5 = SA)
10. I prefer to work on projects alone than in a team. (1 = SD, 5 = SA)

```{r view-orig-levels}
levels(sur1$lecture); levels(sur1$alone)
```

## Collapse Categories of Lecture and Alone

```{r collapse-categories-in-sur2}
sur2 <- sur1 %>%
  mutate(lec2 = fct_recode(lecture,
                          "Activities" = "1",
                          "Activities" = "2",
                          "Neutral" = "3",
                          "Lectures" = "4",
                          "Lectures" = "5"),
         alone2 = fct_recode(alone, 
                             "Team" = "1",
                             "Team" = "2",
                             "Neutral" = "3",
                             "Alone" = "4",
                             "Alone" = "5"))
```

## Result of Collapsing Categories

```{r collapsed-table-sur2}
sur2 %$% table(lec2, alone2) %>% addmargins
```

## Collapsed Contingency Table's Chi-Square test

```{r collapsed-chi2-sur2}
sur2 %$% table(lec2, alone2) %>% chisq.test
```

## Default plot for Categorical Data (Mosaic plot)

```{r, fig.height = 4.5}
plot(sur2$lec2, sur2$alone2)
```

## Plotting Categorical Data (Jitter)

```{r, fig.height = 4.5}
ggplot(sur2, aes(x = lec2, y = alone2)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2) + theme_bw()
```

## Plotting Categorical Data (Bars)

```{r, fig.height = 4.5}
ggplot(sur2, aes(x = lec2, fill = lec2)) +
  geom_bar() + guides(fill = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ alone2)
```






## Airplane Etiquette Example

https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/airplane-etiquette-recline-seat/

FiveThirtyEight asked 1040 people (not all responded) several questions, including:

1. `In general, is it rude to knowingly bring unruly children on a plane?`
2. `Is it rude to recline your seat on a plane?`
3. `Do you ever recline your seat when you fly?`
4. `Do you have any children under 18?`

## The Data

The `flying` data set within the `fivethirtyeight` package provides the data here.

```{r}
fly <- fivethirtyeight::flying %>%
  select(id = respondent_id, recline_frequency, 
         recline_rude, unruly_child, 
         have_kids = children_under_18) %>%
  mutate(have_kids = factor(have_kids)) %>%
  filter(complete.cases(.))
```

## The `fly` data

```{r}
summary(select(fly, unruly_child, have_kids, 
               recline_rude, recline_frequency))
```

## Airplane Etiquette Exercises for Practice

1. Estimate a 90% confidence interval for the proportion of people answering either "Somewhat" or "Very" to the question of whether it is rude to knowingly bring an unruly child on a plane. What is the margin of error?
2. Does the proportion of people who feel it is "Somewhat" or "Very" rude to knowingly bring an unruly child on a plane show a significant association with whether or not they themselves have children under 18 years of age?
3. Given the actual data, what can you conclude about the true proportion of people who feel it is rude to recline your seat on a plane?
4. Is there a significant association between how often you recline (`recline_frequency`) and your feelings about how rude (`recline_rude`) it is to do so?

## Airplane Etiquette Exercises for Practice

Suppose we wish to estimate the power a study wil have to estimate the difference in proportion of people who feel that waking someone up to go for a walk is very or somewhat rude, comparing taller people to shorter people. Suppose we propose a new study, where we will collect data from 1200 tall and 1200 short people, and we look to declare as important any observed difference where one group is at 73% or more, while the other is at 70% or less. 

5. Using a 10% significance level, what power will we have? 
6. To obtain at least 80% power, how big a sample would we need?

## One Type of Three-Way Contingency Table

We'll talk about three-way and larger contingency tables more in 432, but for now, let us focus on the situation where a 2x2 table is repeated over multiple strata (categories in a third variable.)

Duggal et al (2010) did a meta-analysis\footnote{Duggal JK et al. 2010. Effect of niacin therapy on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease. J Cardiovasc Pharmacology \& Therapeutics 15: 158-166.} of 5 placebo-controlled studies (AFREGS, ARBITER2, CLAS1, FATS and HATS) of niacin and heart disease, where the primary outcome was the need to do a coronary artery revascularization procedure. 

- My Source: http://www.biostathandbook.com/cmh.html

## Niacin Meta-Analysis Example

For example, the FATS study had these results:

FATS      | Revascularization | No Revasc. 
--------: | :-----------: | :----------:
Niacin    |  2 | 46  
Placebo   | 11 | 41

- Pr(revascularization | Niacin) = $\frac{2}{2+46}$ = `r round(2/48,3)`
- Odds(revascularization | Niacin) = $\frac{2}{46}$ = `r round(2/46,3)`
- Pr(revascularization | Placebo) = $\frac{11}{11+41}$ = `r round(11/52, 3)` 
- Odds(revascularization | Placebo) = $\frac{11}{41}$ = `r round(11/41,3)`

and so the Odds Ratio = $\frac{2*41}{11*46}$ = `r round((2*41)/(11*46), 2)`.

But, actually, we have data like this for each of five studies!

## Building the Meta-Analysis Table

```{r data for meta analysis}
study <- c(rep("FATS", 4), rep("AFREGS", 4), 
           rep("ARBITER2", 4), rep("HATS", 4), 
           rep("CLAS1", 4))
treat <- c(rep(c("Niacin", "Niacin", 
                 "Placebo", "Placebo"),5))
outcome <- c(rep(c("Revasc.", "No Rev."), 10))
counts <- c(2, 46, 11, 41, 4, 67, 12, 60, 1, 86, 
            4, 76, 1, 37, 6, 32, 2, 92, 1, 93)
meta <- data.frame(study, treat, outcome, counts) %>% tbl_df
meta$treat <- fct_relevel(meta$treat, "Niacin")
meta$outcome <- fct_relevel(meta$outcome, "Revasc.")
meta.tab <- xtabs(counts ~ treat + outcome + study, 
                  data = meta)
```

## Five Studies in the Meta-Analysis

```{r ftable for meta.tab}
ftable(meta.tab)
```

The three variables we are studying are: 

- `treat` (2 levels: Niacin/Placebo), 
- `outcome` (2 levels: Revascularization or No Revascularization) across 
- `study` (5 levels: AFREGS, ARBITER2, CLAS1, FATS, HATS) 

## Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Test

The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test is designed to test whether the rate of revascularization is the same across the two levels of the treatment (i.e. Niacin or Placebo). 

- We *could* do this by simply adding up the results across the five studies, but that wouldn't be wise, because the studies used different populations and looked for revascularization after different lengths of time.
- But we can account for the differences between studies to some extent by adjusting for study as a stratifying variable in a CMH test.
- The big assumption we'll have to make, though, is that the odds ratio for  revascularization given Niacin instead of Placebo does not change across the studies. Is this reasonable in our case?

## Looking at the Study-Specific Odds Ratios

We'll calculate the odds ratios, comparing revascularization odds with niacin vs. placebo, within each separate study. 

Study   | Rev N | Rev P | NoRev N | NoRev P | Odds Ratio
------: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | :------------------:
AFREGS  | 4 | 67 | 12 | 60 | $\frac{4*60}{67*12}$ = `r round((4*60)/(67*12), 2)`
ARBITER2  | 1 | 86 | 4 | 76 | `r round((1*76)/(86*4), 2)`
CLAS1  | 2 | 92 | 1 | 93 | `r round((2*93)/(92*1), 2)`
FATS  | 2 | 46 | 11 | 41 | `r round((2*41)/(46*11), 2)`
HATS  | 1 | 37 | 6 | 32 | `r round((1*32)/(37*6), 2)`

The table shows patient counts for the categories in each of the respective two-by-two tables (Rev N = Revascularization and Niacin, NoRev P = No Revascularization and Placebo, etc.)

## Can we assume a Common Odds Ratio?

The Woolf test checks a key assumption for the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. The Woolf test assesses the null hypothesis of a common odds ratio across the five studies.

```{r woolf test for meta}
woolf_test(meta.tab)
```

Our conclusion from the Woolf test is that we are able to retain the null hypothesis of homogeneous odds ratios. So it's not crazy to fit a test that requires that all of the odds ratios be the same in the population.

## Running the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test

So, we can use the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test to make inferences about the population odds ratio (for revascularization given niacin rather than placebo)  accounting for the five studies. What can we conclude?

```{r CMH for meta.tab}
mantelhaen.test(meta.tab, conf.level = .90)
```

## Complete CMH output

```{r CMH for meta.tab code only, eval=FALSE}
mantelhaen.test(meta.tab, conf.level = .90)
```

```
Mantel-Haenszel chi-squared test with continuity correction

data:  meta.tab
Mantel-Haenszel 
X-squared = 12.746, df = 1, p-value = 0.0003568

alt. hypothesis: true common odds ratio is not equal to 1

90 percent confidence interval: 0.1468942 0.4968686
sample estimates: common odds ratio 0.2701612 
```

What can we conclude in this case?

## The UC Berkeley Student Admissions Example

The UCBAdmissions data set contains aggregate data on applicants to graduate school at Berkeley for the six largest departments in 1973, classified by whether the applicant was admitted, and their sex.

```{r show UCBAdmissions data}
ftable(UCBAdmissions)
```

Do the data show evidence of sex bias in admission practices?

## Summarizing Department D

In Department D, we have 

Department D | Males | Females 
------------:|  ------: | ------: 
Admitted       | 138         | 131
Not Admitted   | 279         | 244
Applicants     | `r 138+279` | `r 131+244`

Pr(Admitted if Male) = $\frac{138}{138+279}$ = `r round(138/(138+279),3)`

Odds(Admitted if Male) = $\frac{138}{279}$ = `r round(138/279,2)`

Pr(Admitted if Female) = $\frac{131}{131+244}$ = `r round(131/(131+244),3)`

Odds(Admitted if Female) = $\frac{131}{244}$ = `r round(131/244,2)`

Odds Ratio (Admit for Male vs Female) = $\frac{138*244}{131*279}$ = `r round((138*244)/(131*279), 2)`

## Can we use the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test?

Are the odds ratios similar across departments?

Department | A | B | C | D | E | F
----------:| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: 
Admitted Males      | 512 | 353 | 120 | 138 | 53 | 22
Male Applicants     | `r 512+313` | `r 353+207` |`r 120+205` |`r 138+279` |`r 53+138` |`r 22+351`
Admitted Females   | 89 | 17 | 202 | 131 |  94 |  24
Female Applicants  | `r 89+19` | `r 17+8` | `r 202+391` | `r 131+244` | `r 94+299` | `r 24+317`
Pr(Admit if Male)   | `r round(512/(512+313),2)` | `r round(353/(353+207),2)` | `r round(120/(120+205),2)` | `r round(138/(138+279),2)` | `r round(53/(53+138),2)` | `r round(22/(22+351),2)`
Pr(Admit if Female)   | `r round(89/(89+19),2)` | `r round(17/(17+8),2)` | `r round(202/(202+391),2)` | `r round(131/(131+244),2)` | `r round(94/(94+299),2)` | `r round(24/(24+317),2)`
Odds(Admit if Male) | `r round(512/313,2)` | `r round(353/207,2)` |`r round(120/205,2)` |`r round(138/279,2)` |`r round(53/138,2)` |`r round(22/351,2)`
Odds(Admit if Female) | `r round(89/19,2)` | `r round(17/8,2)` | `r round(202/391,2)` | `r round(131/244,2)` | `r round(94/299,2)` | `r round(24/317,2)`
**Odds Ratio** | `r round((512*19)/(313*89), 2)` | `r round((353*8)/(207*17), 2)` | `r round((120*391)/(202*205), 2)` | `r round((138*244)/(131*279), 2)` | `r round((53*299)/(94*138), 2)` | `r round((22*317)/(351*24), 2)` 

## Does it make sense to use a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test?

A Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test describes a single combined odds ratio accounting for department. This assumes that the population odds ratio for admission by sex is identical for each of the six strata (departments).

- Does that seem reasonable?
- Or is there a three-way interaction here, where the odds ratios for admission by sex differ significantly across departments?

Department | A | B | C | D | E | F
----------:| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: 
**Odds Ratio** | `r round((512*19)/(313*89), 2)` | `r round((353*8)/(207*17), 2)` | `r round((120*391)/(202*205), 2)` | `r round((138*244)/(131*279), 2)` | `r round((53*299)/(94*138), 2)` | `r round((22*317)/(351*24), 2)` 

How can we test this?

## Woolf Test for Interaction in UCB Admissions

- H~0~: There is no three-way interaction. 
    + Odds ratios are homogenous, and we may proceed with the CMH test.)
- H~A~: There is a meaningful three-way interaction. 
    + CMH test is inappropriate because there are significantly different odds ratios across the departments.

```{r woolf test for UCB Admissions}
woolf_test(UCBAdmissions)
```

Pr (Admitted, regardless of sex) | `r round((512+89)/(825+108),2)` | `r round((353+17)/(560+25),2)` | `r round((120+202)/(325+593),2)` | `r round((138+131)/(417+375),2)` | `r round((53+94)/(191+393),2)` | `r round((22+24)/(373+341),2)`
% of Applicants who are Female | 11.6 | 4.3 | 64.6 | 47.3 | 67.3 | 47.8

>- The apparent association between admission and sex stems from differences in the tendency of males and female to apply to the individual departments.
>- Females used to apply more to departments with lower admission rates.
>- This is a common example related to what is called Simpson's Paradox.

## Simpson's Paradox

Simpson's Paradox refers to a change in the direction of a relationship between two variables, depending on whether or not a third variable is controlled for. 

- The Berkeley admissions result isn't quite a full reversal, but controlling for department has a big impact, so it's nearly a Simpson's paradox.

## Kidney Stone Treatment Example

Suppose we compare the success rates of two treatments for kidney stones.

- 350 patients received Treatment A (all open surgical procedures) and 273 (78%) had a successful result.
- 350 patients received Treatment B (percutaneous nephrolithotomy - less invasive) and 289 (83%) had a successful result.

Which approach would you choose?

Charig CR et al. (1986) PMID 3083922.

## Kidney Stones with additional categorization of small/large stones

But what if we categorized the kidney stones as either small or large?

Disaggregated | Treatment A | Treatment B 
:-----------: | ----------: | ----------:
Small Stones  | 81/87 (93%) | 234/270 (87%)
Large Stones  | 192/263 (73%) | 55/80 (69%)

Aggregated    | Treatment A | Treatment B 
:-----------: | ----------: | ----------:
All Subjects  | 273/350 (78%) | 289/350 (83%)

Now, which treatment looks better?

## Simpson's Paradox and US Wages

From 2000 to 2013, the median US wage rose 0.9%, adjusted for inflation.

But, over the same period, the median wage for

- high school dropouts (down 7.9%)
- high school graduates with no college education (down 4.7%)
- people with some college education (down 7.6%), and
- people with Bachelor's or higher degrees (down 1.2%)

have all decreased.

- Within **every** educational subgroup, the median wage is lower in 2013 than in 2000. How can this happen?
