**Class 5: 2017-09-12**

## Today's Slides

Today's Slides are available for download in both [PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431slides/blob/master/class_05/431_2017_class-05-slides.pdf) and [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431slides/blob/master/class_05/431_2017_class-05-slides.Rmd) formats.

## Announcements before class:

1. **Notes** There is a student in our class who requires a copy of the in-class notes taken by another student in the class. If you believe you take accurate and legible notes, please see Dr. Love at the end of the class, or email him directly for more information. **Compensation is available**. Thank you.

2. If you are interested in [joining the American Statistical Association](https://www.amstat.org/ASA/JoinRenew/JoinMemberType.aspx?membertype=IREG&utm_source=informz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=asa&_zs=XgXOe1&_zl=hsKA4) as a student member, the cost (through September) is only $18. It's $25 after that. The ASA is a terrific organization, and I strongly encourage you to join. I forwarded an email about this to you last night.

3. Most of our discussion today centers on Material from the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431notes/), Sections 4-5, 7-8. We will also discuss the assigned readings in Jeff Leek's *Elements of Data Analytic Style*, and in Nate Silver's *The Signal and the Noise*.

4. I refer in today's class to [FiveThirtyEight.com](http://fivethirtyeight.com/), in particular its [science and health](https://fivethirtyeight.com/science/) section. I also discuss a feature piece from Harry Enten (2017-09-10) entitled [Forecasts Have Done A Good Job Predicting Irma's Shifting Path](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/forecasts-have-done-a-good-job-predicting-irmas-shifting-path/). Harry tweets at [@ForecasterEnten](https://twitter.com/ForecasterEnten) and is also part of the [538 Politics Podcast](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/).

5. To answer your R questions at 431-help at case dot edu, we need to be able to replicate your work. So, if you can, please:

  - send your **entire** R Markdown (.Rmd) file as an attachment,
  - in the body of your email, ask your question, and
  - if you're getting an error message, include it in the body of your email or attach a screenshot
  - Note that it also helps speed a response if you provide something to specify your question in the subject line

6. Reminders from last time:

  - **Webinar**: There is a webinar coming on 2017-09-13 at 11 AM with Garrett Grolemund, one of the authors of [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), about using the tidyverse well to analyze data in R. A recording of the webinar will appear sometime next week [at R Studio's Webinars page](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/).
  - **Audio Recordings** Class 4's recording (in two parts) may be found at the [Class 4 README](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431slides/tree/master/class_04).
  - **The Project** I'll have more on the Project for you on 2017-09-19. after Assignment 1.

## Announcements after class:

7. Visit [this Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/U3a9r3qNRI5XPNQg2) by Thursday 2017-09-14 at noon, and answer the three questions posed there. Doing this will help your class participation grade. Not doing it on time will hurt that grade. Also, if you can do this, you will be able to take our quizzes in the same fashion. Remember to log into Google via CWRU to use the form. If you missed class and are reading this afterwards, please fill out the form by noon Thursday anyway. You'll want to have read *The Signal and the Noise*'s introduction and Chapter 1 first. 

8. [Assignment 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/blob/master/431-2017_assignment-1.md) remains due at noon on 2017-09-15. Submit your R Markdown file and either the Word or HTML file it generates to https://canvas.case.edu/, please. Remember that incomplete work is bad, but not submitting the assignment in a timely fashion is a much, much worse thing to do. Get it in.

9. Readings for the rest of September:

- Read Nate Silver's *The Signal and the Noise* Chapters 2 and 3 by 2017-09-26.
- By the end of the month, I'll expect you to have worked your way through Part A of the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431notes/), although we'll do a lot of that in class.
- I would also be working my way through [R For Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). All of the **Explore** and **Wrangle** material is likely to be helpful in Part A of the course.
- You may also want to look at Chapters 1 and 3 (in particular) of [OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php) as part of your work in Part A.

10. Remember [the words of Roger Peng as tweeted by Brian Caffo](https://twitter.com/bcaffo/status/859864563218620420) and Hadley Wickham (quoting Piet Hien) on the [Road to Wisdom](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/878267930651140097).

11. One last thing - there's a curated pre-print list for a special issue of The American Statistician available at [this PeerJ link](https://peerj.com/collections/50-practicaldatascistats/?utm_content=buffere21d2&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer). Some terrific stuff here, under the general heading of Practical Data Science for Statistics. I hope to delve into some of these later this year.
