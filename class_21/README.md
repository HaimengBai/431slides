## Announcements before class:

0. **VERY IMPORTANT** Tuesday 2017-11-14 11:30 AM - 12:30 PM Office Hours are CANCELLED. Other office hours that day are unaffected. Thank you.

1. Today's Agenda
    - Answering the Airplane Etiquette Exercises posed in Class 20
        - The original [FiveThirtyEight article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/airplane-etiquette-recline-seat/) by Walt Hickey.
    - Some thoughts on p values and statistical significance, introducing the concepts of researcher degrees of freedom and the garden of forking paths.
        - The key references are linked in today's slides, also described in detail [here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/RCR2017).
        - [Andrew Gelman's blog](http://andrewgelman.com/) is how I first heard about much of this material.
        - I'll postpone our planned discussion of retrospective design, power, and Type S and Type M errors for a while, in part because an ASA Symposium entitled [Scientific Method for the 21st Century: A World Beyond p < 0.05](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/ssi/2017/onlineprogram/Program.cfm) was held last month, and touched on a lot of these issues. I need to find more time to read up on what people were saying there, so I can distill it effectively.
    - Two "New" Studies worth a little extra look
        - Stents
        - Advil + Tylenol in the ED

2. Quiz 2
    - A link will appear here after today's class to the Google Form for Quiz 2.
    - A link is coming for a password-protected version of the questions on the Google Form, to facilitate offline work.
    - The data sets you'll need for the Quiz are posted at [our data site](https://github.com/thomaselove/431data).
    - If you have questions, ask them at 431-help.

3. The Projects
     - By now, you've completed Tasks A-C.
            - Actually, as things stand, everyone's completed A, B and the Survey, but one person hasn't finished the Task C Word document. I am still reviewing those materials. We have *n* = 50 respondents to the Survey.
     - [Task D](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/tree/master/TaskD) is due via email to Dr. Love noon Monday, **2017-11-20**.
        - If you're working with NHANES data, I want to know what tables you used, and I want your cleaned tidied data set, but I don't need the raw pulls.

4. Upcoming non-project Deliverables
    - By now, you've completed Assignment 5. An answer sketch will be posted **today**.
    - [Assignment 6](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/blob/master/431-2017_assignment-6.md) is due at noon **2017-12-01**.

5. The play I am appearing in is "**It's a Wonderful Life**" and it is based on the holiday film directed by Frank Capra, starring Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed. I play the role of Uncle Billy, at [Independence Community Theatre](http://www.independencetheatre.org/).

The theater is located at the Old Independence Town Hall, 6652 Brecksville Rd, Independence OH. **PLEASE feel absolutely ZERO obligation to attend**. I mention this so you have the details if you are interested. I would be happy to see you there, but you won't get any extra credit for coming, *nor will I think any less of you should you not attend*.

        - at 8 PM on Friday Nov 10, Saturday Nov 11, and 2 PM on Sunday Nov 12.
