## Announcements before class:

1. Today's Agenda
    - Answering the Airplane Etiquette Exercises posed in Class 20  
            - The original [FiveThirtyEight article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/airplane-etiquette-recline-seat/) by Walt Hickey.
    - Some Half-Baked Thoughts on How To React to Published Research (this material will eventually be pounded into Section 35 of the Course Notes, but not necessarily before 2018.)
        - [Andrew Gelman's blog](http://andrewgelman.com/) is how I first heard about much of this material.
        - See especially [this article by Gelman and Carlin](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/retropower_final.pdf) on Type M and Type S errors.
        - I'll have some more to say about the *p* value "controversy" later this semester.

2. Quiz 2
    - A link will appear here after today's class to the Google Form for Quiz 2.
    - A link is coming for a password-protected version of the questions on the Google Form, to facilitate offline work.
    - The data sets you'll need for the Quiz are posted at [our data site](https://github.com/thomaselove/431data).
    - If you have questions, ask them at 431-help.

3. The Projects
     - By now, you've completed Tasks A-C.
            - Actually, as things stand, everyone's completed A, B and the Survey, but one person hasn't finished the Task C Word document, and I am still reviewing the rest of them.
     - [Task D](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/tree/master/TaskD) is due via email to Dr. Love noon Monday, **2017-11-20**.
        - Many of you could do this task **right now** to get ahead of things a bit. 
        - If you're working with NHANES data, I want to know what tables you used, and I want your cleaned tidied data set, but I don't need the raw pulls.

4. Upcoming non-project Deliverables
    - By now, you've completed Assignment 5. An answer sketch will be posted **today**.
    - [Assignment 6](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/blob/master/431-2017_assignment-6.md) is due at noon **2017-12-01**.

5. The play I am appearing in is "**It's a Wonderful Life**" and it is based on the holiday film directed by Frank Capra, starring Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed. I play the role of Uncle Billy, at [Independence Community Theatre](http://www.independencetheatre.org/). If you would like to attend or want more information, tickets are available for $12 by calling 216-447-0443. The theater is located at the Old Independence Town Hall, 6652 Brecksville Rd, Independence OH. **PLEASE feel absolutely ZERO obligation to attend**. I mention this so you have the details if you are interested. I would be happy to see you there, but you won't get any extra credit for coming, *nor will I think any less of you should you not attend*.
    - Remaining performances are:
        - at 8 PM on Friday Nov 10, Saturday Nov 11, and 2 PM on Sunday Nov 12.
        - and at 8 PM on Friday Nov 17 and Saturday Nov 18.
