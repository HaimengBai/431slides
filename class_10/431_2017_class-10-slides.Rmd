## Project Task B groups

We need ten such groups, each with about 5 people involved.

Google Form is available at https://goo.gl/forms/WaQOdCEAW0wxdjJh2 and needs to be done by 5 PM today.

Task B meetings in class will be held next Tuesday, and also on 2017-10-12.

Details on Task B specified at https://github.com/thomaselove/431project

## The Form's Questions...

```{r taskB-fig, out.width = '90%', fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/taskB.png")
```



## Today's R Setup

```{r packages, message = FALSE}
library(Epi); library(viridis); library(broom)
library(GGally); library(mice)
library(forcats); library(tidyverse)

source("Love-boost.R")
```

## Cleaning up Loose Ends in the VHL Study

```{r load_VHL_data}
VHL <- read.csv("vonHippel-Lindau.csv") %>% tbl_df
```

### Von Hippel - Lindau study Codebook

- `p.ne` = plasma norepinephrine (pg/ml)
- `tumorvol` = tumor volume (ml)
- `disease` = 1 for patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2
- `disease` = 0 for patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease

We want to add a new variable (factor) called `diagnosis`, which takes the values `von H-L` or `neoplasia`.

## Creating a Factor to represent disease diagnosis

We want to add a new variable, specifically a factor, called `diagnosis`, which will take the values `von H-L` or `neoplasia`.

- Recall `disease` is a numeric 1/0 variable (0 = von H-L, 1 = neoplasia)
- Use `fct_recode` from the `forcats` package...

```{r create_diagnosis}
VHL <- VHL %>%
  mutate(diagnosis = fct_recode(factor(disease), 
                                "neoplasia" = "1",
                                "von H-L" = "0")
  )
```

## Now, what does VHL look like?

```{r view_new_VHL}
VHL
```


## Compare the patients by diagnosis

```{r scatter_5_no_facets, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(VHL, aes(x = log(tumorvol), y = p.ne, col = diagnosis)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  stat_smooth(method=lm, se=FALSE) +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 14)) +
  labs(title = "p.ne vs. log(tumorvol), by diagnosis",
       x = "Natural logarithm of Tumor Volume (ml)", y = "Plasma Norepinephrine (pg/ml)")
```

## Facetted Scatterplots by diagnosis

```{r scatter_5_with_facets, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(VHL, aes(x = log(tumorvol), y = p.ne, col = diagnosis)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  stat_smooth(method=lm) +
  facet_wrap(~ diagnosis) +
  guides(color = FALSE) +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 14)) +
  labs(title = "p.ne vs. log(tumorvol), by diagnosis",
       x = "Natural logarithm of Tumor Volume (ml)", y = "Plasma Norepinephrine (pg/ml)")
```

## Model accounting for different slopes and intercepts

```{r model2}
model2 <- lm(p.ne ~ log(tumorvol) * diagnosis, data = VHL)
model2
```

## Model 2 results

`p.ne` = 417 + 220 log(`tumorvol`) - 893 (`diagnosis = neoplasia`) + 125 (`diagnosis = neoplasia`)*log(`tumorvol`)

where the indicator variable (`diagnosis = neoplasia`) = 1 for neoplasia subjects, and 0 for other subjects...

- Model for `p.ne` in von H-L patients: 
    + 417 + 220 log(`tumorvol`)
- Model for `p.ne` in neoplasia patients: 
    + (417 - 893) + (220 + 125) log(`tumorvol`) 
    + -476 + 345 log(`tumorvol`)
    
## Model 2 Predictions

What is the predicted `p.ne` for a single new subject with `tumorvol` = 55 ml (so log(tumorvol) = `r round(log(55),2)`) in each diagnosis category?

```{r model2predictionsneoplasia}
predict(model2, newdata = data_frame(tumorvol = 55, 
        diagnosis = "neoplasia"), interval = "prediction")
```

```{r model2predictionVHL}
predict(model2, newdata = data_frame(tumorvol = 55, 
        diagnosis = "von H-L"), interval = "prediction")
```

## The `broom` package

```{r, message = FALSE}
tidy(model2)
```

## The `broom` package

```{r, warning = FALSE}
newdat <- augment(model2)

head(newdat, 2)
```

## The `broom` package

```{r, message = FALSE}
glance(model2)
```

## The Western Collaborative Group Study

Original description: 3524 men aged 39-59 and employed in the San Francisco Bay or Los Angeles areas were enrolled in 1960 and 1961. In addition to determinations of behavior pattern, the initial examination included medical and parental history, socioeconomic factors, exercise, diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, diet, serum lipid and lipoprotein studies, blood coagulation studies, and cardiovascular examination.

The WCGS data describe 3,154 subjects and 22 variables. For now, let's examine a few interesting variables, and a sample of 500 of the observations.

```{r sample 500 observations and select the variables of interest}
wcgs.full <- read.csv("wcgs.csv")
wcgs.full <- tbl_df(wcgs.full)
```

## Select the variables of interest, and sample 500 subjects

```{r select the variables of interest and sample 500 subjects}
set.seed(43101)
wcgs1 <- 
  wcgs.full %>%
  select(id, age, chol, arcus, dibpat, bmi, 
         wghtcat, smoke, ncigs, chd69) %>%
  sample_n(500, replace = FALSE)
```

## Resulting tibble

```{r see the wcgs1 tibble, echo=FALSE}
wcgs1
```

## Codebook

Name    | Stored As  | Type         | Details (units, levels, etc.)
-------:|:----------:|:------------:|------------------------------------
`id`      | integer    | (nominal)  | ID #, nominal and uninteresting
`age`     | integer    | quantitative | age, in years - no decimal places
`chol`    | integer    | quantitative | total cholesterol, mg/dL
`arcus`   | integer | (nominal) | arcus senilis present (1) or absent (0)
`dibpat`  | factor (2) | (binary)  | behavioral pattern: A or B
`bmi`     | number     | quantitative | body-mass index
`wghtcat` | factor (4) | (ordinal) | wt: < 140, 140-170, 170-200, > 200
`smoke`   | factor (2) | (binary)  | cigarette smoker: Yes or No
`ncigs`   | integer | quantitative | number of cigarettes smoked per day
`chd69`   | factor (2) | (binary) | CHD event: Yes or No


## Summary of this sample (without `id`)

![](images/summary1.png)

```{r summary of wcgs1}
summary(wcgs1)[,-1]
```

## A Key Research Question

Were the men with Type A behavioral patterns more likely to suffer a CHD event?

```{r table of dibpat by chd69}
table(wcgs1$dibpat, wcgs1$chd69)
```

What's not so great about this table?

## Re-specify the factor to re-order of the levels

```{r relevel the chd69 factor into new variable chdevent}
wcgs1$chdevent <- 
  factor(wcgs1$chd69, levels = c("Yes", "No"))
tab1 <- table(wcgs1$dibpat, wcgs1$chdevent)
tab1
```

and this is **standard epidemiological format**.

## Aha! A Two-by-Two Table!

```{r two by two table analysis from Epi library}
twoby2(tab1) ## twoby2 is part of the Epi package
```

## A 4 by 2 table

```{r four by two attempt 1}
table(wcgs1$wghtcat, wcgs1$chdevent)
```

Why is this a poor table?

## An Improved 4 x 2 table

```{r four by two attempt 2}
wcgs1$wghtcat <- factor(wcgs1$wghtcat, 
       levels = c("< 140", "140-170", "170-200", "> 200"))
tab2 <- table(wcgs1$wghtcat, wcgs1$chdevent)
knitr::kable(tab2)
```

## A Three-Way Table (Not Flattened)

```{r make three way table}
table(wcgs1$dibpat, wcgs1$wghtcat, wcgs1$chdevent)
```

## A Three-Way Table (Flattened)

```{r make three way flattened table}
ftable(wcgs1$dibpat, wcgs1$wghtcat, wcgs1$chdevent)
```

## How can we describe the distribution of BMI?

```{r distribution of BMI, echo=FALSE}
p1 <- ggplot(wcgs1, aes(x = bmi)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "navy", col = "yellow") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 18)) +
  labs(x = "Body-Mass Index", y = "# of Subjects")

p2 <- ggplot(wcgs1, aes(sample = bmi)) +
  geom_qq(col = "navy", size = 2) + 
  theme(text = element_text(size = 18)) +
  labs(y = "sample BMI values")

gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```

## Summary of BMI data

```{r favstats for BMI data}
mosaic::favstats(wcgs1$bmi)
psych::describe(wcgs1$bmi)
```

## Comparing BMI by Behavior Pattern

```{r distribution of BMI by behavior pattern, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(wcgs1, aes(x = dibpat, y = bmi, fill = dibpat)) +
  geom_boxplot(notch = TRUE, outlier.size = 2) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 18)) +
  scale_fill_viridis(discrete=TRUE, option = "plasma") +
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(x = "Behavior Pattern", y = "Body-Mass Index")
```

## Numerical BMI summaries, by behavior pattern

```{r favstats for BMI data by dibpat}
by(wcgs1$bmi, wcgs1$dibpat, mosaic::favstats)
```

## How about Total Cholesterol, instead?

```{r distribution of cholesterol, echo=FALSE}
p1 <- ggplot(wcgs1, aes(x = chol)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "salmon", col = "white") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 18)) +
  labs(x = "Total Cholesterol", y = "# of Subjects")

p2 <- ggplot(wcgs1, aes(sample = chol)) +
  geom_qq(col = "salmon", size = 2) + 
  theme(text = element_text(size = 18)) +
  labs(y = "sample Cholesterol values")

gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```

## Why did we get error warnings?

```{r favstats for cholesterol data}
mosaic::favstats(wcgs1$chol)
psych::describe(wcgs1$chol)
```

## What should we do about missing values?

1. `ggplot2` doesn't include missing values in the plot, but it does warn that they've been removed. 
    + We could suppress that warning by setting `na.rm = TRUE` in the call to a geom like `geom_histogram` or `geom_qq`.

## Plot with `na.rm = TRUE`

```{r distribution of cholesterol attempt 2, echo=FALSE}
p1 <- ggplot(wcgs1, aes(x = chol)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "salmon", col = "white", na.rm=TRUE) +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 18)) +
  labs(x = "Total Cholesterol", y = "# of Subjects")

p2 <- ggplot(wcgs1, aes(sample = chol)) +
  geom_qq(col = "salmon", size = 2, na.rm=TRUE) + 
  theme(text = element_text(size = 18)) +
  labs(y = "sample Cholesterol values")

gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```

## Classification of Missing Data

There are three classifications we will think about in 431. Subtleties abound, but these three will suffice for most practical work.

- MCAR: Missing *Completely at Random*. This is the desirable scenario for us. MCAR means that there is no relationship between the probability of a data point being missing, and any values in the data set, either missing or observed. 
    + The missing data are just a random subset of the data. 
    + This is one kind of "ignorable" missingness.


## Classification of Missing Data

- MAR: Missing *at Random*, which is definitely an unfortunate name. Less desirable, but there is still some hope. MAR means that the probability of a data point being missing has nothing to do with the missing value that would have been observed, but does have something to do with the values of some other variable that you did observe. 
    + The idea is that if we can control for this other variable in our analysis, then we can treat this missingness as just a random subset of the data after that adjustment, which will eventually be pretty straightforward. 
    + This is another kind of "ignorable" missingness.

## Classification of Missing Data

- MNAR: Missing *not at Random* is a more serious issue. Now, additional thought and some special methods may well be required. Here, there is a relationship between the probability that a value is missing and what the actual (missing) value is. 
    + This is what we mean by "non-ignorable" missingness.
    + Multiple Imputation methods (and Maximum Likelihood approaches) assume the data are MAR or MCAR, so the important distinction, generally, is between "at random" vs. "not at random."
    
- Some of these explanations come from [`this link`](http://www.theanalysisfactor.com/missing-data-mechanism/)

## What should we do about missing values?

2. At times you will want to try to understand what makes observations with missing values different from observations with meaningful recorded values, especially if we're thinking that the missing mechanism is MCAR or MAR.
    + We might, for instance, compare the BMI values or perhaps the smoking status for those with and without missing cholesterol values, using the `is.na()` function to make a new variable to indicate those subjects without a cholesterol level.

## For Tuesday: Working with Tables

For Class 11, I'd like you to read a 1981 paper by A.S.C. Ehrenberg that you'll find linked on the Class 10 README.

The paper is called *The Problem of Numeracy* and it provides some very helpful tips for working with tables, in particular.

There are three key tips related to the development of tables, in practice, as described by Ehrenberg, and also by Howard Wainer\footnote{Visual Revelations (1997), Chapter 10.} who concisely states them as:

1. Order the rows and columns in a way that makes sense.
2. Round - a lot!
3. ALL is different and important.
