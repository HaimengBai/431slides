## Types of Data (and see the Course Notes, section 4.3)

Data can be **quantitative (numerical)** or **qualitative (categorical)**

- **Quantitative**
    + Variables recorded in numbers that we use as numbers.
    + All quantitative variables must have units of measurement.
    + Can break into *continuous* (may take any value in a range) or *discrete* (limited set of potential values.)
        - Height is certainly continuous as a concept, but how precise is our ruler?
        - Piano vs. Violin
    + (less common) *interval* (equal distances between values, but zero point is arbitrary) as compared to *ratio* variables (a meaningful zero point.)
        - Is *weight* an interval or ratio variable? How about *IQ*?
    + Taking a mean or median is a reasonable idea.

## Types of Data (and see Part A Notes, section 2)

Data can be **quantitative (numerical)** or **qualitative (categorical)**

- Qualitative 
    + Variables consisting of names of categories.
    + Each possible value is a code for a category (could use numerical or non-numerical codes.)
        + *Binary* categorical variables (two categories, often labeled 1 or 0)
        + *Multi-categorical* variables (usually taken to be 3+ categories)
    + Also, *nominal* (no underlying order) or *ordinal* (categories are ordered.)
        - How is your overall health? (Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, Poor)
        - Which candidate would you vote for if the election were held today?
        - Did this patient receive this procedure?

## Day 1 Survey Handout

![](images/day1form.png)

## Evaluating some Day 1 Survey variables

1. Do you **smoke**? (1 = Non-Smoker, 2 = Former Smoker, 3 = Smoker)
2. How much did you pay for your most recent **haircut**? (in $)
3. What is your favorite **color**?
4. How many hours did you **sleep** last night?
5. Has statistical thinking been important in your life? (1 = Not at all important to 7 = Extremely important)

### Are these quantitative or qualitative?

- If quantitative, are they *discrete* or *continuous*? Do they have a meaningful *zero point*?
- If qualitative, how many categories? *Nominal* or *ordinal*?
    
## Day 1 Survey

![](images/2017-setup.png)

## Day 1 Survey

- 48 people completed it Tuesday
- Another 64 did it in 2016, 49 did in 2015, and another 42 in 2014.

### Question 1

About how many of those 203 surveys caused *no problems* in recording responses?

## Today's Steps

We assume you were able to follow the software installation instructions.

1. Get data from our web site and store it in a new directory on your machine.
2. Open R Studio and start a Project, selecting the new directory for the Project.
3. Open and set up an R Markdown file to do the work.
4. Write code in your R Markdown file to 

    - load the data in R
    - load up the `tidyverse` suite of R packages you'll need
    - look at the data
    - visualize the data
    - summarize the data numerically
    - compare the data
    - build a model for the data

5. Compile your R Markdown file to generate an HTML or Word document.

## Analyzing the Index Card Guesses of My Age

47 students turned in an index card, meant to contain both a first and a second guess of my age. 

Step 1: Get the Data

- I've stored the data in a .csv file on our web site, for instance, at 

\color{blue} https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431slides/tree/master/class_02 \color{black}


- We'll grab just that data file, for now, by clicking on it, selecting Raw, and saving the resulting **age-love-2017.csv** file to our computer.
- Specifically, we'll save it to a new directory called **431class2**.

## Class 2 Github page - select the age-love-2017.csv file

![](images/ss01.png)

## Right-click Raw to download (just) this file, into a 431class2 directory, please.

![](images/ss02.png)

## What the file looks like

![](images/ss02a.png)


## Open R Studio and start a New Project

![](images/ss03.png)

## We'll select our existing 431class2 directory for this project.

![](images/ss04.png)

##

![](images/ss05.png)

##

![](images/ss06.png)

##

![](images/ss07.png)

## Now we are in our new Project space.

![](images/ss08.png)

## Start a new R Markdown file

![](images/ss09.png)

## Fill in your name and title for the analysis

![](images/ss10.png)

## A sample Markdown file is generated. Let's knit it into an HTML file.

![](images/ss11.png)

## Save your work as age-love-analysis.Rmd

![](images/ss12.png)

## The result - a web file!

![](images/ss13.png)

## Edit the file to change the setup materials

![](images/ss14.png)

## Insert a new "chunk" of R code

![](images/ss15.png)

## A blank "chunk"

![](images/ss16.png)

## Load up two packages in R (should be installed already)

![](images/ss17.png)

## Import the .csv data set

![](images/ss18.png)

## Import window

![](images/ss19.png)

## After we make our choices...

![](images/ss20.png)

## Result (note code in Console)

![](images/ss21.png)

## Add data load code to Markdown and also look at the data

![](images/ss22.png)

## Running the code so we can see results

![](images/ss23.png)

## Or run all of the "chunks" up to a particular point

![](images/ss24.png)

## Running the first three chunks of code

![](images/ss25.png)

## Now, let's look at the data

![](images/ss26.png)

## The `age_love_2017` tibble

![](images/ss27.png)

## Typing in some documentation, mixing text with R code.

![](images/ss28.png)

## Let's make a histogram

![](images/ss29.png)

## The result. Can we do better?

![](images/ss30.png)

## A second attempt at the histogram

![](images/ss31.png)

## A numerical summary of the data

![](images/ss32.png)

## Calculating and Summarizing the Errors

![](images/ss33.png)

## What do these summaries suggest?

![](images/ss34.png)

## Build a scatterplot to compare the errors

![](images/ss35.png)

## A new scatterplot, with a model for the relationship of age1 to age2

![](images/ss36.png)

## Plot the age1 - age2 differences

![](images/ss37.png)

## Numerical summary of the age1 - age2 differences

![](images/ss38.png)

## How many people thought I looked younger the second time?

![](images/ss39.png)


## T tests - making a statistical inference

![](images/ss40.png)

## Knit the file into an HTML document

![](images/ss41.png)

## Adjust the YAML to fold the code on demand

![](images/ss42.png)

## New, more final, report

![](images/ss43.png)


## Analyzing the Survey Data - A little challenge

We have data on the site in a file called `surveyday1_2017.csv`. Build a project to study those data. 

Put the data in a file called `surv1` in R. 

- I'd call my R Markdown file `day1surveyanalysis`

Can you reproduce the following...

## A. That fill color is called *salmon*, I used 20 bins.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(surv1, aes(x = pulse)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 20, col = "blue", fill = "salmon") +
    labs(x = "Pulse Rate of 202 students in 431", 
         y = "# of Students",
         title = "Pulse Rates of 202 students in 431",
         subtitle = "One student had a missing pulse value")
```

## Code for Plot A.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(surv1, aes(x = pulse)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 20, 
                   col = "blue", fill = "salmon") +
    labs(x = "Pulse Rate of 202 students in 431", 
         y = "# of Students",
         title = "Pulse Rates of 202 students in 431",
         subtitle = "One student had a missing pulse value")
```

## B. Histograms of Pulse Rates, by Year

```{r boxplot-pulse-by-year, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(surv1, aes(x = pulse, fill = year)) + 
    geom_histogram(bins = 15, col = "white") + 
    facet_wrap(~ year) +
    guides(fill = FALSE) +
    labs(title = "Pulse Rate, by Year")
```

## Code for Plot B.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(surv1, aes(x = pulse, fill = year)) + 
    geom_histogram(bins = 15, col = "white") + 
    facet_wrap(~ year) +
    guides(fill = FALSE) +
    labs(title = "Pulse Rate, by Year")
```


## C.Boxplot of Age Guesses, by Year

```{r boxplot-age-by-sex, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(surv1, aes(x = factor(year), y = ageguess, fill = factor(year))) + 
    geom_boxplot() + 
    labs(title = "Age Guess, by Year")
```

## Code for Plot C

```{r , eval = FALSE}
ggplot(surv1, aes(x = factor(year), y = ageguess, 
                  fill = factor(year))) + 
    geom_boxplot() + 
    labs(title = "Age Guess, by Year")
```

## Summary Table of Age Guesses, by Year

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
surv1 %>%
    group_by(year) %>%
    summarize(n = n(),
              mean = mean(ageguess, na.rm=TRUE), 
              sd = sd(ageguess, na.rm=TRUE), 
              median = median(ageguess, na.rm=TRUE) 
              )
```

## Code for Summary Table

```{r, eval = FALSE}
surv1 %>%
    group_by(year) %>%
    summarize(n = n(),
              mean = mean(ageguess, na.rm=TRUE), 
              sd = sd(ageguess, na.rm=TRUE), 
              median = median(ageguess, na.rm=TRUE) 
              )
```
