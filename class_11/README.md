## Announcements before class:

1. Today's agenda:
    1. Discussion of [Assignment 3](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/tree/master/HW3)
    2. Discussion of Scatterplot and Correlation Matrices materials from the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431notes/).
    3. Discussion of Cross-Tabulations and Ehrenberg's [The Problem of Numeracy](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431slides/blob/master/class_11/Ehrenberg_1981_pw_The_Problem_of_Numeracy.pdf), in the context of [this Supplementary Table](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431slides/blob/master/class_11/431_2017_class-11-supplementary-table.pdf). 
    4. [Project Task B](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/tree/master/TaskB) Group Meetings. We suggest you work on Parts 2 and 3 of Task B in class on 2017-10-03, and on Parts 1 and 4 in class on 2017-10-12. You will also (likely) need to find time outside of class for additional group work before the due date. We encourage you to consider using technology to facilitate your group work.
    5. Brief discussion of Jeff Leek's *Elements of Data Analytic Style* Chapters 1-4 and 12.

2. [Quiz 1](https://thomaselove.github.io/431syllabus/quizzes.html) is coming to you on 2017-10-05 and is due at noon on **2017-10-09**. What is fair game on the quiz?
    - everything in Part A of the [Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431notes/), 
    - everything we've discussed in [classes 1-11](https://github.com/thomaselove/431slides), 
    - everything we've encountered in the first three [Assignments](https://github.com/thomaselove/431homework), and 
    - everything we've read and discussed in Silver, in Leek and in Ehrenberg.

3. Upgrading R to R 3.4.2, which came out on 2017-09-28, is something you should consider doing, perhaps as soon as you've turned in Quiz 1. Follow the [instructions on installing R](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431/blob/master/software-installation-431.md), and then update your R Packages from within R Studio. If your version of R Studio begins with 1.1, then you are running the preview version and should be fine. If it begins with 1.0, you might want to try upgrading to the preview version as in the [installation materials](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431/blob/master/software-installation-431.md), but, again, after the Quiz.

4. Upcoming Readings/Assignments/Deadlines:
    - Read *The Signal and the Noise* Chapters 4-5 (Weather and Earthquake Predictions), and Leek's Chapter 6 by **2017-10-10**.
    - [Project Task A](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/tree/master/TaskA) is due at noon on **2017-10-13**.
    - Read Silver's Chapters 7 and 8 (Disease Outbreaks and Bayes' Theorem) by **2017-10-17**.
    - [Assignment 4](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/blob/master/431-2017_assignment-4.md) is due at noon on **2017-10-20**.
