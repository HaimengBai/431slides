# Course Grades will be posted by the registrar as soon as possible

Your grade in the course is determined as follows:

## Up to 30 points for the Project

- First we calculate your Project score which is the sum of your 
    - Tasks A-D (maximum 30 points, and most of the deductions are for late or incomplete work)
    - Task E (maximum 30 points and most people scored between 18 and 26)
    - Task F (maximum 40 points and most people scored between 27 and 36)
- We multiply the Project score by 0.3 to produce your **Project points** (on a scale from 0-30). 

For Project points, the class mean was 26.3 / 30. (That's 87.7%)

## Up to 30 points for the Quizzes

- We calculate your Quiz score (0-100 points) by adding 
    - Your Quiz 1 points 
    - Your (Quiz 2 points)/1.2
    - Your Quiz 3 points
- and then dividing that sum by 3.2.
- We multiply that Quiz score by 0.3 to produce your **Quiz points** (on a scale from 0-30). 

For Quiz points, the class mean was 24.5 / 30. (That's 81.8%)

## Up to 25 points for the Homework

- We calculate your Homework score (0-100 points) by first summing
    - Your Assignment 1 points times 100/65
    - Your Assignment 2 points
    - Your Assignment 3 points
    - Your Assignment 4 points times 120/145
    - Your Assignment 5 points
    - Your Assignment 6 points times 10/7
- and then dividing that sum by 6.45
- To that number we add 2.5 points for each of the four essays written through the semester you wrote where the teaching assistants and I thought was one of the best 5-6 essays we read. 2 students received points for 3 essays, 5 students for 2, and 9 students for 1.
- Take the minimum of that sum and 102, and that's your Homework Score (usually on a scale of 0-100).
- We divide the Homework score by 4 to produce your **Homework points** (on a scale from 0-25). 

For Homework points, the class mean was 22.4 / 25. (That's 89.4%)

## Up to 15 points for Participation in and out of Class. 

- Your **Participation Points** were determined by Dr. Love after consulting with the teaching assistants.
    - 12 students received 100% of the available credit here.
    - Everyone received at least 11 points out of 15 on this measure.

For Participation points, the class mean was 13.7 / 15. (That's 91.3%)

## Calculating Your Total Points

- Add up your Project points, your Quiz points, your Homework points and your Participation Points to get Total Points.
    - Students with Total Points of 85 to 98 received a course grade of A.
    - Students with Total Points of 75 to 83 received a course grade of B. 
        - No one had Total Points between 83.0 and 85.0, and no one was below 75.
