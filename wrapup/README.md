# End of Semester Wrap Up page

This is the place for all of Dr. Love's communications after our final class.

## Announcements

1. Good luck on the Quiz and your Project!

2. Getting Help after Dec 8
    - If you are having trouble with R, and asking for help at 431-help, we need to first replicate your problem in order to solve it. So, **PLEASE**:
        1. Send your **entire** R Markdown file. All of it. Not pieces of it. All of it.
        2. Send a **screenshot** of the error message you are receiving, AND specify the line number where things break down if you can in your email. Or ask a specific and detailed question - as specific and detailed as you can make it.
        3. If this is about "your data" **send the data** set(s) that your R Markdown calls. If this is about the class survey data, we have that. But we don't have your data.
        4. Please don't wait until you've been struggling with a problem so long that you feel frustrated or feel the need to tell us how long that's been to garner our sympathy. Struggle for 15 minutes with the demonstration files, then Google or search the course notes for at most another 15 minutes, then email us, is a reasonable workflow. Coding is hard enough with help.
        5. **Don't wait** until the last day. I warn you that I am thoroughly unavailable on Mon 12-11 and Tue 12-12 except for a little bit of time between projects. In particular, I am booked both of those evenings.

3. I will be one of five featured singers in the annual Wassail Christmas Concert given by the Chagrin Studio Orchestra on December 22 and 23 starting at 6:15 (wassail and cookies), 7:00 (downbeat) each evening. Wrap yourself up in the music of the season with 40+ of Cleveland's finest musicians for a mere $25 (adults) and $15 (students). If you are interested, visit [CVLT's Tickets page](https://app.arts-people.com/index.php?show=81251). 

4. **432** 
    - Want to get a leg up on 432? I cannot promise I'll have anything ready for you before January 18, I'm afraid. 
    - If you want to see a list of potential topics for 432 and some indication of likely emphasis, [click here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431slides/blob/master/class_27/taskafter26.md) and scroll down. I've linked a few things there.
    - I'll encourage you to continue working with R, and a very useful thing to do is read [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and work on some of the trickier materials there.
    - I'll also encourage you to look at Jenny Bryan's [Happy Git with R](http://happygitwithr.com/), and be sure to email me your GitHub account name.
