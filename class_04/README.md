## Today's Slides

Today's Slides are available for download in both [PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431slides/blob/master/class_04/431_2017_class-04-slides.pdf) and [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431slides/blob/master/class_04/431_2017_class-04-slides.Rmd) formats.

## Announcements before class:

1. **Webinar**: There is a webinar coming on 2017-09-13 at 11 AM with Garrett Grolemund, one of the authors of [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), about
using the tidyverse well to analyze data in R. "*This introduction to the tidyverse will cover several best practices for analyzing data with R. You’ll learn how the ggplot2, dplyr, and purrr packages (along with the rest of the tidyverse) work together to create an improved way to use R, and you’ll master several “bedrock” functions along the way. This would be a good webinar to recommend to your R curious colleagues.*" If you would like to register for the webinar (which is free, but limited to the first 1,000 live attendees) visit 
https://pages.rstudio.net/September13_Registration.html. Otherwise, you can wait a few days, and a recording of the webinar will be posted [at R Studio's Webinars page](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/).

2. **Notes** There is a student in our class who requires a copy of the in-class notes taken by another student in the class. If you believe you take accurate and legible notes, please see Dr. Love at the end of the class, or email him directly for more information. Thank you.

3. **Audio Recordings** A student in the class (C.W. Gallagher) has been kind enough to send me audio recordings of Classes 2 and 3. If you would find this helpful, I've posted downloadable versions to the [Class 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431slides/tree/master/class_02) and [Class 3](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431slides/tree/master/class_03) slides pages, respectively. We'll keep this up as we can. Thank you, C.W.! 

4. **The Project** I'll have more on the Project for you on 2017-09-19. after Assignment 1.

5. Most of our discussion centers on the Visualization material in the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431notes/), Section 3.

6. I make reference in today's class to the great work of Jenny Bryan at https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files. Take a look!

7. I also can't recommend [PhD Comics](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1531) and [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1179/) enough.

8. As you roll along, remember that learning R is a process. Heed the [wisdom of Dan Quintana](https://twitter.com/dsquintana/status/904728820904845312), and especially that of [Steve Klabnik as tweeted by Glitch](https://twitter.com/glitch/status/869932324238094336).

## Announcements after class:

8. On Tuesday, we'll do more with the NHANES example in the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431notes/), sections 4-6. 
  + There's a small error in section 4.2 that I will fix soon - referring to ...[the data] "consists" instead of "consist". 
  + Then in section 5.5, I misspelled "difference" in talking about the Gini mean difference statistic. I'll fix these issues in the document before the weekend. +2 to Jack McDonnell for these.
  + The **big** issue is that if you find things like this, I **really** want you to email me about them. 

9. Read Nate Silver's *The Signal and the Noise* Introduction and Chapter 1 by 2017-09-12

10. [Assignment 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/blob/master/431-2017_assignment-1.md) remains due at noon on 2017-09-15. Submit your R Markdown file and either the Word or HTML file it generates to https://canvas.case.edu/, please.
