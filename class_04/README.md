**Class 4: 2017-09-07**

Today's Slides are available for download in both [PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431slides/blob/master/class_04/431_2017_class-04-slides.pdf) and [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431slides/blob/master/class_04/431_2017_class-04-slides.Rmd) formats.

## Announcements before class:

1. **Webinar**: There is a webinar coming on 2017-09-13 at 11 AM with Garrett Grolemund, one of the authors of [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), about
using the tidyverse well to analyze data in R. "*This introduction to the tidyverse will cover several best practices for analyzing data with R. You’ll learn how the ggplot2, dplyr, and purrr packages (along with the rest of the tidyverse) work together to create an improved way to use R, and you’ll master several “bedrock” functions along the way. This would be a good webinar to recommend to your R curious colleagues.*" If you would like to register for the webinar (which is free, but limited to the first 1,000 live attendees) visit 
https://pages.rstudio.net/September13_Registration.html. Otherwise, you can wait a few days, and a recording of the webinar will be posted [at R Studio's Webinars page](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/).

2. **Notes** There is a student in our class who requires a copy of the in-class notes taken by another student in the class. If you believe you take accurate and legible notes, please see Dr. Love at the end of the class, or email him directly for more information. Thank you.
