## Course Notes, Chapter 3 on Visualization

The packages we're using are `NHANES`, `viridis` and `tidyverse`.

```
library(NHANES)
library(viridis)
library(tidyverse)
```

## The NHANES data: Collecting a Sample

To begin, we'll gather a random sample of 1,000 subjects participating in NHANES, and then identify several variables of interest about those subjects. See Baumer, Kaplan and Horton (2017) *Modern Data Science with R*. Use `?NHANES` to learn more about the data.

```{r}
set.seed(431001) 
# use set.seed to ensure that we all 
# get the same random sample 
# of 1,000 NHANES subjects in nh_data

nh_data <- sample_n(NHANES, size = 1000) %>%
    select(ID, Gender, Age, Height, Weight, BMI, 
           Pulse, Race1, HealthGen, Diabetes)
```

## The `nh_data` tibble

```{r, echo=FALSE}
nh_data
```


## Relationship of Height and Age - First Attempt

```{r nh_data_heightbyage1-fig, fig.height = 3}
ggplot(data = nh_data, aes(x = Age, y = Height)) +
    geom_point()
```

## Interesting Results from Our First Attempt

1. Only `r sum(!is.na(nh_data$Age) & !is.na(nh_data$Height))` subjects are plotted, because the remaining `r 1000 - sum(!is.na(nh_data$Age) & !is.na(nh_data$Height))` people have missing (NA) values for either Height, Age or both. 
2. Unsurprisingly, the measured Heights of subjects grow from Age 0 to Age 20 or so, and we see that a typical Height increases rapidly across these Ages. The middle of the distribution at later Ages is pretty consistent at a Height somewhere between 150 and 175. The units aren't specified (must be cm). The Ages are in years.
3. No Age is reported over 80, and it appears that there is a large cluster of Ages at 80. 

## Subset of Subjects with Known Age and Height

Before we move on, let's manipulate the data set a bit, to focus on only those subjects who have complete data on both Age and Height. This will help us avoid that warning message.

```{r nh_data_datawithcompleteageandheight}
nh_dat2 <- nh_data %>%
    filter(complete.cases(Age, Height))
```

## Revised Height by Age plot (using `nh_dat2`)

```{r nh_dat2_heightbyage2-fig, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(data = nh_dat2, aes(x = Age, y = Height)) +
    geom_point()
```

## Adding Gender to the picture

**Goals**

1. Add gender to the plot using color.
2. Adjust axis labels to show units of measurement.

```{r nh_data_heightbyageandgender1-figcode, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_dat2, 
       aes(x = Age, y = Height, 
           color = Gender)) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(title = "Height-Age Relationship in NHANES sample", 
         y = "Height in cm.")
```

Result on next slide...

## Age-Height and Gender?

```{r nh_data_heightbyageandgender1-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
ggplot(data = nh_dat2, 
       aes(x = Age, y = Height, 
           color = Gender)) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(title = "Height-Age Relationship in NHANES sample", 
         y = "Height in cm.")
```


## Can we show the Female and Male relationships in separate panels?

Sure. Add `facet_wrap(~ Gender)` 

- Don't forget to add the `+` sign at the end of the preceding line, too.

```{r nh_data_heightbyageandgender2-figcode, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_dat2, 
       aes(x = Age, y = Height, 
           color = Gender)) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(title = "Height-Age Relationship in NHANES sample", 
         y = "Height in cm.") +
    facet_wrap(~ Gender)
```

## Faceting by Gender

```{r nh_data_heightbyageandgender2-fig, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_dat2, 
       aes(x = Age, y = Height, 
           color = Gender)) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(title = "Height-Age Relationship in NHANES sample", 
         y = "Height in cm.") +
    facet_wrap(~ Gender)
```


## Can we add a smooth curve to show the relationship in each plot?

Yep, and let's change the theme of the graph to remove the gray background, too.

```{r nh_data_heightbyageandgender3-figcode, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_dat2, aes(x = Age, y = Height, color = Gender)) +
    geom_point() + 
    geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
    labs(title = "Height-Age Relationship in NHANES sample", 
         y = "Height in cm.") +
    theme_bw() +
    facet_wrap(~ Gender)
```

## With Smooth Curves (from `loess`)

```{r nh_data_heightbyageandgender3-fig, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_dat2, aes(x = Age, y = Height, color = Gender)) +
    geom_point() + 
    geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
    labs(title = "Height-Age Relationship in NHANES sample", 
         y = "Height in cm.") +
    theme_bw() +
    facet_wrap(~ Gender)
```

## What if we want to assume straight line relationships?

We could look at a linear model in the plot. Does this make sense here?

```{r nh_data_heightbyageandgender4-figcode, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_dat2, 
       aes(x = Age, y = Height, color = Gender)) +
    geom_point() + 
    geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
    labs(title = "Height-Age Relationship in NHANES sample", 
         y = "Height in cm.") +
    theme_bw() +
    facet_wrap(~ Gender)
```

## Linear Models for each Gender

```{r nh_data_heightbyageandgender4-fig, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_dat2, 
       aes(x = Age, y = Height, color = Gender)) +
    geom_point() + 
    geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
    labs(title = "Height-Age Relationship in NHANES sample", 
         y = "Height in cm.") +
    theme_bw() +
    facet_wrap(~ Gender)
```

## A Subset: Ages 21-79

Suppose we wanted to look at a subset of our sample - those observations (subjects) whose Age is at least 21 and at most 79. We'll create that sample below, and also subset the variables to include nine of particular interest, and remove any observations with any missingness on *any* of the nine variables we're including here. 

```{r identify nh_data subjects ages 21-79}
nh_data_2179 <- nh_data %>%
    filter(Age > 20 & Age < 80) %>%
    select(ID, Gender, Age, Height, Weight, BMI, 
           Pulse, Race1, HealthGen, Diabetes) %>%
    na.omit
```

## The `nh_data_2179` tibble

```{r}
nh_data_2179
```

## Distribution of Height

[CWRU's color guide](https://case.edu/umc/our-brand/visual-guidelines/) specifies CWRU blue and CWRU gray.

```{r nh_data_2179_histogramwithCWRUscheme-figcode, eval = FALSE}
cwru.blue <- '#0a304e'
cwru.gray <- '#626262'

ggplot(data = nh_data_2179, aes(x = Height)) + 
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, 
                   col = cwru.gray, fill = cwru.blue) + 
    labs(title = "Height of NHANES subjects ages 21-79",
         x = "Height in cm.") +
    theme_bw()
```

## Distribution of Height (in CWRU colors)

```{r nh_data_2179_histogramwithCWRUscheme-fig, echo = FALSE}
cwru.blue <- '#0a304e'
cwru.gray <- '#626262'

ggplot(data = nh_data_2179, aes(x = Height)) + 
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, 
                   col = cwru.gray, fill = cwru.blue) + 
    labs(title = "Height of NHANES subjects ages 21-79",
         x = "Height in cm.") +
    theme_bw()
```

## A Boxplot of Height by Gender

```{r nh_data_2179_heightbygenderbox-figcode, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_data_2179, 
       aes(x = Gender, y = Height, fill = Gender)) + 
    geom_boxplot() + 
    labs(title = "Boxplot of Height by Gender 
         for NHANES subjects ages 21-79",
         y = "Height in cm.")
```

## Boxplot: Height by Gender (ages 21-79)

```{r nh_data_2179_heightbygenderbox-fig, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_data_2179, 
       aes(x = Gender, y = Height, fill = Gender)) + 
    geom_boxplot() + 
    labs(title = "Height by Gender Boxplot (NHANES ages 21-79)",
         y = "Height in cm.")
```

## Faceted Histograms of Height by Gender

```{r nh_data_2179_heightbygenderhist2-figcode, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_data_2179, 
       aes(x = Height, fill = Gender)) + 
    geom_histogram(color = "white", bins = 20) + 
    labs(title = "Height by Gender Boxplot (NHANES ages 21-79)",
         x = "Height in cm.") + 
    guides(fill = FALSE) +
    facet_grid(Gender ~ .)
```

## Faceted Histograms of Height by Gender

```{r nh_data_2179_heightbygenderhist2-fig, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_data_2179, 
       aes(x = Height, fill = Gender)) + 
    geom_histogram(color = "white", bins = 20) + 
    labs(title = "Height by Gender for NHANES subjects ages 21-79",
         x = "Height in cm.") + 
    guides(fill = FALSE) +
    facet_grid(Gender ~ .)
```

    + You are **absolutely supposed** to use Google and the TAs (and me) to improve your code.

## A Look at Body-Mass Index

Let's look at a different outcome, the *body-mass index*, or BMI. The definition of BMI for adult subjects (which is expressed in units of kg/m^2^) is:

$$
\mbox{BMI} = \frac{\mbox{weight in kg}}{(\mbox{height in meters})^2} = 703 \times \frac{\mbox{weight in pounds}}{(\mbox{height in inches})^2}
$$

BMI is, essentially, a measure of a person's *thinnness* or *thickness*.

- BMI from 18.5 to 25 indicates optimal weight
- BMI below 18.5 suggests person is underweight
- BMI above 25 suggests overweight. 
- BIM above 30 suggests obese.

## Histogram of BMI

Here's a histogram, again with CWRU colors, for the BMI data.

```{r nh_data_2179_bmihistbin1-figcode, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_data_2179, aes(x = BMI)) + 
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, 
                   fill = cwru.blue, col = cwru.gray) + 
    labs(title = "Histogram of BMI (NHANES ages 21-79)",
         x = "Body-mass index")
```

## Histogram of BMI with binwidth 1

```{r nh_data_2179_bmihistbin1-fig, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_data_2179, aes(x = BMI)) + 
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, 
                   fill = cwru.blue, col = cwru.gray) + 
    labs(title = "Histogram of BMI (NHANES ages 21-79)",
         x = "Body-mass index")
```

## Histogram of BMI with binwidth 5

```{r nh_data_2179_bmihistbin2-fig, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_data_2179, aes(x = BMI)) + 
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, 
                   fill = cwru.blue, col = cwru.gray) + 
    labs(title = "Histogram of BMI (NHANES ages 21-79)",
         x = "Body-mass index")
```

## BMI and Diabetes

We can split up our histogram into groups based on whether the subjects have been told they have diabetes.

```{r nh_data_2179_bmibydiabetes-figcode, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_data_2179, 
       aes(x = BMI, fill = Diabetes)) + 
    geom_histogram(color = "white", bins = 20) + 
    labs(title = "BMI by Diabetes Status (NHANES ages 21-79)",
         x = "Body-mass index") + 
    facet_grid(Diabetes ~ .)
```

## BMI and Diabetes

```{r nh_data_2179_bmibydiabetes-fig, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_data_2179, 
       aes(x = BMI, fill = Diabetes)) + 
    geom_histogram(color = "white", bins = 20) + 
    labs(title = "BMI by Diabetes Status (NHANES ages 21-79)",
         x = "Body-mass index") + 
    facet_grid(Diabetes ~ .)
```

## Numerical Summary: BMI and Diabetes

How many people fall into each of these Diabetes categories, and what is their "average" BMI?

```{r numerical_summary_bmi_and_diabetes_tab}
nh_data_2179 %>%
    group_by(Diabetes) %>%
    summarize(count = n(), mean(BMI), median(BMI)) %>%
    knitr::kable() 
```

## BMI by Race

How many people fall into each of the five `Race1` categories, and what is their "average" BMI?

```{r}
nh_data_2179 %>%
    group_by(Race1) %>%
    summarize(count = n(), mean(BMI), median(BMI)) %>%
    knitr::kable() 
```

## BMI and Race Boxplot

```{r nh_data_2179_bmibyrace-figcode, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_data_2179, 
       aes(x = Race1, y = BMI, fill = Race1)) + 
    geom_boxplot() +
    guides(fill = FALSE) +
    labs(title = "BMI by Race (NHANES ages 21-79)",
         x = "Body-mass index") 
```    

## BMI and Race Boxplot

```{r nh_data_2179_bmibyrace-fig, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_data_2179, 
       aes(x = Race1, y = BMI, fill = Race1)) + 
    geom_boxplot() +
    guides(fill = FALSE) +
    labs(title = "BMI by Race (NHANES ages 21-79)",
         x = "Body-mass index") 
```   


## BMI and Pulse Rate

```{r nh_data_2179_bmivspulse-figcode, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_data_2179, aes(x = BMI, y = Pulse)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
    labs(title = "BMI vs. Pulse rate (NHANES ages 21-79)")
```

## BMI and Pulse Rate

```{r nh_data_2179_bmivspulse-fig, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_data_2179, aes(x = BMI, y = Pulse)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
    labs(title = "BMI vs. Pulse rate (NHANES ages 21-79)")
```

## Diabetes vs. No Diabetes

Could we see whether subjects who have been told they have diabetes show different BMI-pulse rate patterns than the subjects who haven't? 

- Let's try doing this by changing the **shape** *and* the **color** of the points based on diabetes status.

```{r nh_data_2179_bmivspulsewithdm-figcode, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_data_2179, 
       aes(x = BMI, y = Pulse, 
           color = Diabetes, shape = Diabetes)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
    labs(title = "BMI vs. Pulse rate (NHANES ages 21-79)") +
    facet_wrap(~ Diabetes)
```


## Does Diabetes status affect Pulse-BMI relationship?

```{r nh_data_2179_bmivspulsewithdm-fig, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_data_2179, 
       aes(x = BMI, y = Pulse, 
           color = Diabetes, shape = Diabetes)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
    labs(title = "BMI vs. Pulse rate (NHANES ages 21-79)") +
    facet_wrap(~ Diabetes)
```

## The Leek text

**Bring at least one (written down) question and/or comment about something in the text that is meaningful to you.**


1. What was the most important thing you learned in reading the Leek materials?
2. What was the muddiest, least clear thing?

## Leek Chapter 5: Exploratory Analysis

- EDA To understand properties of the data and discover new patterns
- Visualize and inspect qualitative features rather than a huge table of raw data

1. Make big data as small as possible as quickly as possible
2. Plot as much of the actual data as you can
3. For large data sets, subsample before plotting
4. Use log transforms for ratio measurements
5. Missing values can have a mighty impact on conclusions

## Leek: Chapter 9 Written Analyses

Elements: title, introduction/motivation, description of statistical tools used, results with measures of uncertainty, conclusions indicating potential problems, references

1. What is the question you are answering?
2. Lead with a table summarizing your tidy data set (critical to identify data versioning issues)
3. For each parameter of interest report an estimate and measure of uncertainty on the scientific scale of interest
4. Summarize the importance of reported estimates
5. Do not report every analysis you performed

## Leek: Chapter 10 Creating Figures

Communicating effectively with figures is non-trivial. The goal is clarity.

> When viewed with an appropriately detailed caption, (a figure should) stand alone without any further explanation as a unit of information.

1. Humans are best at perceiving position along a single axis with a common scale
2. Avoid chartjunk (gratuitous flourishes) in favor of high-density displays
3. Axis labels should be large, easy to read, in plain language
4. Figure titles should communicate the plot's message
5. Use a palette (like `viridis`) that color-blind people can see (and distinguish) well

Karl Broman's **[excellent presentation on displaying data badly](https://github.com/kbroman/Talk_Graphs)** and related issues.

## Leek Chapter 13: A Few Matters of Form

- Variable names should always be reported in plain language.
- If measurements are only accurate to the tenths digit, don't report estimates with more digits.
- Report estimates followed by parentheses that hold a 95% CI or other measure of uncertainty.
- When reporting *p* values, censor small values (*p* < 0.0001, not *p* = 0 or *p* = 1.6 x 10^-25^)

## General Health Status

Here's a Table of the General Health Status results. This is a self-reported rating of each subject's health on a five point scale (Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, Poor.)

```{r tabHealthGen1-tab}
nh_data_2179 %>%
    select(HealthGen) %>%
    table() %>%
    addmargins()
```


The HealthGen data are categorical, which means that summarizing them with averages isn't as appealing as looking at percentages, proportions and rates.

## Bar Chart for Categorical Data

Usually, a **bar chart** is the best choice for a graphing a variable made up of categories.

```{r HealthGengraph1-figcode, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_data_2179, aes(x = HealthGen)) + 
    geom_bar()
```

## Original Bar Chart of General Health

```{r HealthGengraph1-fig, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_data_2179, aes(x = HealthGen)) + 
    geom_bar()
```

## Improving the Bar Chart

There are lots of things we can do to make this plot fancier.

```{r HealthGengraph2-figcode, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_data_2179, 
       aes(x = HealthGen, fill = HealthGen)) + 
    geom_bar() + 
    guides(fill = FALSE) +
    labs(x = "Self-Reported Health Status",
         y = "Number of NHANES subjects",
         title = "Self-Reported Health Status (NHANES ages 21-79)")
```


## The Improved Bar Chart

```{r HealthGengraph2-fig, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_data_2179, 
       aes(x = HealthGen, fill = HealthGen)) + 
    geom_bar() + 
    guides(fill = FALSE) +
    labs(x = "Self-Reported Health Status",
         y = "Number of NHANES subjects",
         title = "Self-Reported Health Status (NHANES ages 21-79)")
```

## Or, we can really go crazy... (code on next slide)

```{r HealthGengraph3-fig, echo = FALSE}
nh_data_2179 %>%
    count(HealthGen) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    mutate(pct = round(prop.table(n) * 100, 1)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = HealthGen, y = pct, fill = HealthGen)) + 
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
    scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +
    guides(fill = FALSE) +
    geom_text(aes(y = pct + 1,    # nudge above top of bar
                  label = paste0(pct, '%')),  # prettify
              position = position_dodge(width = .9), 
              size = 4) +
    labs(x = "Self-Reported Health Status",
         y = "Percentage of NHANES subjects",
         title = "Self-Reported Health Status (NHANES ages 21-79)") +
    theme_bw()
```

## What crazy looks like...

```{r HealthGengraph3-figcode, eval = FALSE}
nh_data_2179 %>%
    count(HealthGen) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    mutate(pct = round(prop.table(n) * 100, 1)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = HealthGen, y = pct, fill = HealthGen)) + 
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
    scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +
    guides(fill = FALSE) +
    geom_text(aes(y = pct + 1,    # nudge above top of bar
                  label = paste0(pct, '%')),  # prettify
              position = position_dodge(width = .9), 
              size = 4) +
    labs(x = "Self-Reported Health Status",
         y = "Percentage of NHANES subjects",
         title = "Self-Reported Health Status (NHANES ages 21-79)") +
    theme_bw()
```


## Working with Tables

We can add a marginal total, and compare subjects by Gender, as follows...

```{r tabHealthGen2kable-tab}
nh_data_2179 %>%
    select(Gender, HealthGen) %>%
    table() %>%
    addmargins() %>%
    knitr::kable()
```

## Getting Row Proportions

We'll use `prop.table` and get the row proportions by feeding it a 1.

```{r tabHealthGen4-tab}
nh_data_2179 %>%
    select(Gender, HealthGen) %>%
    table() %>%
    prop.table(.,1) %>%
    round(.,2) %>%
    knitr::kable()
```

## BMI by General Health Status

Let's consider now the relationship between self-reported overall health and body-mass index.

```{r nh_data_2179_bmibyhealth-figcode, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_data_2179, 
       aes(x = HealthGen, y = BMI, fill = HealthGen)) + 
    geom_boxplot() + 
    labs(title = "BMI by Health Status (NHANES 21-79)",
         y = "Body-mass index", 
         x = "Self-Reported Overall Health") + 
    guides(fill = FALSE) 
```

## What happens with the `Poor` category?

```{r nh_data_2179_bmibyhealth-fig, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_data_2179, 
       aes(x = HealthGen, y = BMI, fill = HealthGen)) + 
    geom_boxplot() + 
    labs(title = "BMI by Health Status (NHANES 21-79)",
         y = "Body-mass index", 
         x = "Self-Reported Overall Health") + 
    guides(fill = FALSE) 
```

## Not many people self-identify with the `Poor` category

```{r}
nh_data_2179 %>%
    group_by(HealthGen) %>%
    summarize(count = n(), mean(BMI), median(BMI)) %>%
    knitr::kable() 
```

## BMI by Gender and General Health Status

We'll start with two panels of boxplots to try to understand the relationships between BMI, General Health Status and Gender. Note the use of `coord_flip` to rotate the graph 90 degrees.

```{r nh_data_2179_bmibyhealthbygender1-figcode, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_data_2179, 
       aes(x = HealthGen, y = BMI, fill = HealthGen)) + 
    geom_boxplot() + 
    labs(title = "BMI by Health Status (NHANES ages 21-79)",
         y = "Body-mass index", 
         x = "Self-Reported Overall Health") + 
    guides(fill = FALSE) +
    facet_wrap(~ Gender) + 
    coord_flip()
```

## BMI by Gender and General Health Status Boxplots


```{r nh_data_2179_bmibyhealthbygender1-fig, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_data_2179, 
       aes(x = HealthGen, y = BMI, fill = HealthGen)) + 
    geom_boxplot() + 
    labs(title = "BMI by Health Status (NHANES ages 21-79)",
         y = "Body-mass index", 
         x = "Self-Reported Overall Health") + 
    guides(fill = FALSE) +
    facet_wrap(~ Gender) + 
    coord_flip()
```

## Histograms of BMI by Health and Gender

Here's a plot of faceted histograms, which might be used to address similar questions.

```{r nh_data_2179_bmibyhealthbygender2-figcode, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_data_2179, 
       aes(x = BMI, fill = Gender)) + 
    geom_histogram(color = "white", bins = 20) + 
    labs(title = "BMI by Gender, Overall Health (NHANES 21-79)",
         x = "Body-mass index") + 
    guides(fill = FALSE) +
    facet_grid(HealthGen ~ Gender)
```

- Note the new approach with `facet_grid`...

## Histograms of BMI by Health and Gender

```{r nh_data_2179_bmibyhealthbygender2-fig, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_data_2179, 
       aes(x = BMI, fill = Gender)) + 
    geom_histogram(color = "white", bins = 20) + 
    labs(title = "BMI by Gender, Overall Health (NHANES 21-79)",
         x = "Body-mass index") + 
    guides(fill = FALSE) +
    facet_grid(HealthGen ~ Gender)
```

## Conclusions

This is just a small piece of the toolbox for visualizations that we'll create in this class. Many additional tools are on the way, but the main idea won't change. Using the `ggplot2` package, we can accomplish several critical tasks in creating a visualization, including:

- Identifying (and labeling) the axes and titles
- Identifying a type of `geom` to use, like a point, bar or histogram
- Changing fill, color, shape, size to facilitate comparisons
- Building "small multiples" of plots with faceting

Good data visualizations make it easy to see the data, and `ggplot2`'s tools make it relatively difficult to make a really bad graph.


## Kidney Cancer Death Rates

Your map shows U.S. counties. 

- The shaded counties are in the top 10% of age-standardized rates for death due to cancer of the kidney/ureter for white males, in 1980-1989.

## Your Tasks

1. Describe the patterns you see in the map.
2. Speculate as to the cause of these patterns.

## What's next?

- More on the NHANES example (Notes Chapters 4-6)
- Read Silver Introduction and Chapter 1 (about 50 denser pages) by 2017-09-12
- Assignment 1 is due 2017-09-15 at noon
- I'll tell you more about the project after Assignment 1.

## Notes on the Kidney Cancer example, 1

I first asked you what you noticed about the map, in the hope that someone would point out the obvious pattern, which is that many of the countries in the Great Plains but relatively few near the coasts are shaded.

- Why might that be? Could these be the counties with more old people? Ah, but these rates are age-adjusted.
- They're mostly in rural areas: could the health care there be worse than in major cities? Or perhaps people living in rural areas have less healthy diets, or are exposed to more harmful chemicals? Maybe, but the confusing fact is that the highest 10% and the lowest 10% each show disproportionately higher rates in those Great Plains counties.

## Notes on the Kidney Cancer example, 2

- Consider a county with 100 white males. If it has even one kidney death in the 1980s, its rate is 1 per thousand per year, which is among the highest in the nation. If it has no such deaths, its rate will be 0, which is the lowest in the nation.
- The observed rates for smaller counties are *much* more variable, and hence they are more likely to be shaded, even if nothing special is truly going on.
- If a small county has an observed rate of 1 per thousand per year, it's probably random fluctuation. But if a large county (like Cuyahoga) has a very high rate, it is probably a real phenomenon.

## Source

My source for this example was Andrew Gelman and Deborah Nolan's book *Teaching Statistics: a bag of tricks* which is the source of a number of things we'll see in the course, including some of the "age guessing" example we've previously done.
