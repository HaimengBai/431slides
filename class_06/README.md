## Today's Slides

Today's Slides are available for download in both [PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431slides/blob/master/class_06/431_2017_class-06-slides.pdf) and [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431slides/blob/master/class_06/431_2017_class-06-slides.Rmd) formats.

## Announcements before class:

1. Today we focus on Material from the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431notes/) especially Chapter 8.

2. [Assignment 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/blob/master/431-2017_assignment-1.md) remains due at noon on 2017-09-15. Submit your R Markdown file and either the Word or HTML file it generates to https://canvas.case.edu/, please. 

- Remember that incomplete work is bad, but not submitting the assignment on time is MUCH worse. Get it in by noon. 
- I'll address some of the most frequently seen questions people have sent about this assignment in class today. 
- We will post the **answer sketch** for Assignment 1 online over the weekend, as soon as we believe that everyone has turned in the Assignment.

3. [Assignment 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/blob/master/431-2017_assignment-2.md) has been reposted to add a few clarifying hints. It is due at noon on 2017-09-22.

4. Readings for the rest of September:

- Read Nate Silver's *The Signal and the Noise* Chapters 2 (Political Predictions) and 3 (Baseball predictions) by 2017-09-26.
- By the end of the month, work your way through Part A of the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431notes/). Next week, we'll cover Chapters 9-11 extensively, and 12-13 (which show detailed examples) more lightly.
- I also suggest working your way through [R For Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). All of the **Explore** and **Wrangle** material is likely to be helpful in Part A of the course.

5. Other Updates and Reminders:

  - A PDF of the slides from Garrett Grolemund's webinar about using the tidyverse well to analyze data in R [is now available](https://github.com/rstudio/webinars/blob/master/46-tidyverse-visualisation-and-manipulation-basics/00-Tidyverse-webinar.pdf). A recording of the webinar will appear in time [at R Studio's Webinars page](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/).
  - **Audio Recordings** Class 5's recording (in two parts) may be found at the [Class 5 README](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431slides/tree/master/class_05).
  - **The Project** I'll have more on the Project for you on 2017-09-19. after Assignment 1.
