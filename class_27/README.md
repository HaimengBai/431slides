2. Remaining Course Deliverables
    - [Project Task E](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/tree/master/TaskE): the final report, due noon Wednesday 2017-12-13.
        - I've changed the Project Task E instructions to ask you to submit your work via **Canvas**, rather than email.
        - You don't need to merge the survey files into a new .csv in Study 1, so no Study 1 data set should be submitted.
        - You are welcome to restrict yourself to complete data (outcomes and predictors) in Study 1 and Study 2. We'll impute in 432.
    - [Project Task F](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/tree/master/TaskF): the final presentation. The [Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/blob/master/TaskF/SCHEDULE.md) is still here.
    - **Quiz 3** will be made available today by 5 PM and is due at noon on Tuesday **2017-12-12** (*note change*). 
    - **Appealing HW Grades**: If you want me to regrade an assignment, review the [Grade Appeal Policy](https://thomaselove.github.io/431syllabus/general-course-policies.html#grade-appeal-policy---wait-until-december) in the Syllabus, and then request a regrade by filling out [this Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/v5zBIuGnrLkbiuXU2) before noon on Wednesday **2017-12-13**. Grades on Assignment 6 will be made available to you as soon as possible.
    - **Course Evaluations** You will get at least two evaluations for this course. The official one from the University should be in your email already. Please complete it. It's important. I will also ask you to fill out one for me about specific details of the class, soon. 
    - **Office Hours** TA office hours conclude on Friday 2017-12-08. 431-help remains open through next Thursday 2017-12-14. If you need to meet with a TA next week, you can try to arrange that through 431-help.
