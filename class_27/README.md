## Announcements before class:

1. Today's Agenda
    - Discussion of [Task after Class 26](https://goo.gl/forms/0YAdfGQIufanWSnG2)
    - Regression Material
    - Setup for Quiz 3
     
2. Remaining Course Deliverables
    - [Project Task E](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/tree/master/TaskE): the final report, due noon Wednesday 2017-12-13.
        - I've changed the Project Task E instructions to ask you to submit your work via **Canvas**, rather than email.
        - You don't need to merge the survey files into a new .csv in Study 1, so no Study 1 data set should be submitted.
        - You are welcome to restrict yourself to complete data (outcomes and predictors) in Study 1 and Study 2. We'll impute in 432.
    - [Project Task F](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/tree/master/TaskF): the final presentation. The [Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/blob/master/TaskF/SCHEDULE.md) is still here.
    - **Quiz 3** will be made available today by 5 PM and is due at noon on Tuesday **2017-12-12** (*note change*). 
    - **Appealing HW Grades**: If you want me to regrade an assignment, review the [Grade Appeal Policy](https://thomaselove.github.io/431syllabus/general-course-policies.html#grade-appeal-policy---wait-until-december) in the Syllabus, and then request a regrade by filling out [this Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/v5zBIuGnrLkbiuXU2) before noon on Wednesday **2017-12-13**. Grades on Assignment 6 will be made available to you as soon as possible.
    - **Course Evaluations** You will get at least two evaluations for this course. The official one from the University should be in your email already. Please complete it. It's important. I will also ask you to fill out one for me about specific details of the class, soon. 

3. Getting Help
    - **Office Hours** TA office hours conclude on Friday 2017-12-08. 431-help remains open through next Thursday 2017-12-14. If you need to meet with a TA next week, you can try to arrange that through 431-help.
    - If you are having trouble with R, and asking for help at 431-help, we need to first replicate your problem in order to solve it. So, **PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, WE'RE BEGGING YOU, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE**:
        1. Send your **entire** R Markdown file. All of it. Not pieces of it. All of it.
        2. Send a **screenshot** of the error message you are receiving, AND specify the line number where things break down if you can in your email. Or ask a specific and detailed question - as specific and detailed as you can make it.
        3. If this is about "your data" **send the data** set(s) that your R Markdown calls. If this is about the class survey data, we have that. But we don't have your data.
        4. Please don't wait until you've been struggling with a problem so long that you feel frustrated or feel the need to tell us how long that's been to garner our sympathy. Struggle for 15 minutes with the demonstration files, then Google or search the course notes for at most another 15 minutes, then email us, is a reasonable workflow. Coding is hard enough with help.
        5. **Don't wait** until the last day. If you need instant help, we can rarely provide that, and never when you need it most, as it turns out. Somehow, the world will conspire to guarantee that we are  unavailable at the exact moment when you need an incredibly fast response. So don't need one. I warn you that I am thoroughly unavailable on the evenings of Mon 12-11 and Tue 12-12.

## Announcements after class:
