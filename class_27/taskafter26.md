# Some Results from the Task After Class 26

# Confidence Regarding Deliverables (n = 44)

Question (0 = not satisfied/confident at all, 10 = extremely satisfied/confident) | Mean | SD | % 7 or higher
:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | -----: | -----: | :----:
Do you feel satisfied with your performance on **Assignment 6**? | 6.18 | 1.96 | 47.7
Do you feel confident about your ability to do well on **Quiz 3**? | 7.02 | 1.34 | 70.5
Do you feel confident about your ability to do work you'll be proud of in your **Project**? | 7.25 | 1.12 | 75.0

# Questions About 431 (some of which I can answer)

1. When fitting a model, if I have female (= 1 or 0) as a variable, do I need to treat it as a factor?
2. When is Bayesian augmentation important?
3. Besides the most obvious predictors, what is the best way to select predictors for regression models? How do you know if using the "step" function to decrease the number of variables in a model gives you an appropriate vs inappropriate answer?
4. How does all that we have learned about checking assumptions translate into the kind of information we should be including in our publications?
5. What, in your opinion, is the most effective strategy for trying to devise a data visualization to compliment a regression model?
6. Could linear regression be used in most statistical problems?
7. How is choosing one method of analysis over another not like fishing for the result you want?  It does not seem possible to pre-specify the specific tests that I will use before I have the data to work with, but doesn't intellectual rigor and honesty require that?
8. Can we get a PDF version of the class notes?
9. Will we still have access to the class notes after December 14? After June 2018?
10. What do you think is the most important concept we learned from 431 that will pertain to a future career as a biostatistician?
11. How qualified am I after 431 to perform data analysis in the real world without continuing on to 432?
12. Following the 431 class, what is your best recommendation to stay up to date with using the knowledge and skills we have gained (specific websites, textbooks etc) to continue to learn about statistical models, R etc?

# Potential 432 Topics So Far

My goal, honestly, is to write the course in terms of a series of case studies, and discuss them through the semester. So far, I have three years of past notes and slides, and no desire to use any of them as they are. We'll see what happens between December 15 and January 15.
