4. I mentioned last time that I am rehearsing a play. The play is "It's a Wonderful Life" and it is based on the holiday film directed by Frank Capra, starring Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed. I play the role of Uncle Billy, and it's happening at [Independence Community Theatre](http://www.independencetheatre.org/index.htm). The play opens this coming Friday Nov 3 at 8 PM, and runs for seven performances over the next three weekends. If you would like to attend or want more information, tickets are available for $12 by calling 216-447-0443. The theater is located at the Old Independence Town Hall, 6652 Brecksville Rd, Independence OH. 
    - **PLEASE feel absolutely ZERO obligation to attend**. I mention this so you have the details if you are interested. I would be happy to see you there, but you won't get any extra credit for coming, *nor will I think any less of you should you not attend*.
