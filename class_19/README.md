## Announcements before class:

1. Today's Agenda
    - Comparing Proportions/Rates [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431notes/) Sections 29-31, in particular.
    - Short Discussion of [Assignment 4](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/blob/master/431-2017_assignment-4.md) for which a [sketch](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/tree/master/HW4), [rubric](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/blob/master/HW4/431-rubric4-2017.pdf) and [grades](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/blob/master/HW4/431-grades4-pw-2017.pdf) are now posted.
    - Short Demonstration of the `eda.1sam` and `eda.2sam` functions that are part of `Love-boost.R`
   
2. The Projects
     - [Task C](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/tree/master/TaskC) will be due at noon on Wednesday, **2017-11-08**. 
        - The Class Survey is [now available as a Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/bB1xJ16NnLihP9Gu1) accepting responses.
        - You **also need** to submit [this Word template](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/blob/master/TaskC/2017_task_C_template_for_YOUR_NAME.docx) via Canvas by noon on 2017-11-08. [A PDF version](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/blob/master/TaskC/2017_What-does-the-Project-Task-C-template-look-like.pdf) is also available so you can see what is required.
        - Details on the scales used in the survey and how they will be included in the project data [are available, too]((https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/blob/master/TaskC/SCALES.md).
        - **BEFORE YOU SUBMIT**: Three points of clarification based on questions that came in this week.
            1. Your Project Task B group existed only to work on Task B. For Tasks C-F, you're working either alone or with your one partner, as previously specified.
            2. In Task C, you need to specify either a paired sample or independent sample analysis, so the other one will be blank on your template.
            3. Your various selected analyses in the Task C template need not be related to one another or to the work your Task B group did, at all. You can address wildly different issues from one analysis to the next of the class survey, if you prefer.
    - [Task D](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431project/tree/master/TaskD) is due via email to Dr. Love noon Monday, **2017-11-20**.
        - Many of you could do this task **right now** to get ahead of things a bit. Note that this is a **corrected** date.

3. Upcoming non-project Deliverables
    - [Assignment 5](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/blob/master/431-2017_assignment-5.md) is now due at noon on Thursday **2017-11-09**. You should be able to do questions 1 and 5-10 already, and today's class should prepare you for questions 2-4.
    - Quiz 2 will be released on Thursday 2017-11-09 by 5 PM and is due on Monday **2017-11-13** at noon.
        - We built a brief [additional example on key Part A material](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/tree/master/Extra_A) is available. [Answer Sketch here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/blob/master/Extra_A/extra_A.pdf).
        - Many key Part B materials are reviewed in Sections 27 and 36 of the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431notes/index.html) which also contain answer sketches.

4. I mentioned last time that I am rehearsing a play. The play is "It's a Wonderful Life" and it is based on the holiday film directed by Frank Capra, starring Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed. I play the role of Uncle Billy, and it's happening at [Independence Community Theatre](http://www.independencetheatre.org/index.htm). The play opens this coming Friday Nov 3 at 8 PM, and runs for seven performances over the next three weekends. If you would like to attend or want more information, tickets are available for $12 by calling 216-447-0443. The theater is located at the Old Independence Town Hall, 6652 Brecksville Rd, Independence OH. 
    - **PLEASE feel absolutely ZERO obligation to attend**. I mention this so you have the details if you are interested. I would be happy to see you there, but you won't get any extra credit for coming, *nor will I think any less of you should you not attend*.

5. The recently updated (2017-10-26) New York Times visualization [You Draw It: Just How Bad is the Drug Overdose Epidemic](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/04/14/upshot/drug-overdose-epidemic-you-draw-it.html) may be discussed today.
